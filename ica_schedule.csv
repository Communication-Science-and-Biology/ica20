Cultures of Uncertainty in the Digital Age,Panel Session,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique",22-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,CC U ROOM 9 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel examines the strategic uses of and responses to uncertainty in emerging digital technologies. It brings together case studies in electronic surveillance and deepfakes, state-sponsored disinformation campaigns and digital activism across diverse geographic contexts. By focusing on uncertainty not as error or byproduct, but a normal aspect of the social life of digital media, the panel emphasises the role of ambiguity, speculation and imagination in the contemporary crisis of information and credibility online. The past few years have seen intensifying public and policy debate over the societal value of digital media, and the kind of politics they facilitate. The Internet, intended to democratise information and voice to promote rational publics, often yields new asymmetries of visibility and knowability. Scholars have shown how ‘black-boxed’ algorithmic decision-making erodes transparency and accountability (e.g. Pasquale 2015, O’Neil 2016, Noble 2018, Zuboff 2019). The Internet has a long record of facilitating censorship and politics of doubt as much as liberal public spheres (e.g. Morozov 2006, Turner 2019). Social media has proven fertile ground for disinformation and hate speech. These ongoing crises demand greater conceptual nuance that interrogates the presumed connections between calculability and certainty, data and knowledge, communication and reason. Accordingly, there has been growing attention to the productive functions of ignorance, forgetting, and ‘not knowing’ (e.g. Japp 2000, Chun 2015, Procter 2008). Building on these insights, the four papers on this panel address uncertainty head on by examining its diverse manifestations as normal and productive aspects of our digital media. In doing so, they challenge enduring epistemological associations of information with meaning, objectivity and control. Ristovska situates algorithmically derived synthetic images such as deepfakes in a longer history of visual media, arguing that uncertainty is an irreducible and integral part of visual meaning-making. Yet the fear of not knowing is pervasive. Hong shows how contemporary state surveillance systems respond by repackaging incomplete and questionable data to bear the imprimatur of data-driven fact. Uncertainty can thus be strategically leveraged for political purposes. Al-Ghazzi traces the Syrian regime’s deliberate manufacture of uncertainty on social media in service of authoritarian state control. Meanwhile, Ferrari turns to digital activists across Italy and the United States, where uncertainty over visibility on social media pushes civil society into the arms of platform hegemony. Together, the papers contend that these uncertainties, and how we respond to them, are crucial to foreclosing or opening up the political possibilities of digital technologies.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Omar Al-Ghazzi, The London School of Economics & Political Science;Discussant: Mark Andrejevic, Monash U;Participant: Elisabetta Ferrari, U of Pennsylvania;Chairs: Sun-ha Hong, Simon Fraser U;Participant: Sun-ha Hong, Simon Fraser U;Chairs: Sandra Ristovska, U of Colorado Boulder;Participant: Sandra Ristovska, U of Colorado Boulder",Deepfakes and the Power of Uncertainty,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,S.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: All Ears on Research: Applying Auditory Learning Tools for Promoting Your Research and Advancing Your Teaching,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,22-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:„In the hierarchy of senses, vision blocks and marginalizes sound, touch, taste and scent. Our understanding of the world comes via our eyes.” (Brabazon, 2012, p. 1) Whether we are reading a paper, attending a presentation or watching a video, we are mostly focusing on visual literacy to learn about new ideas, academic debates or research results. In contrast to that, the potential of sound and sonic media remains often untapped when communication research and teaching in higher education. This Blue Sky Workshop explores techniques and tools of auditory learning, including podcasts and audiobooks, that go beyond the visual and allow for more complex modes of learning through ‘blind listening’. In preparation of the workshop, participants are asked to reflect on prior experiences with sonic media in the classroom or in the communication of their own research projects and research results. The workshop will provide you with examples and best practice examples of integrating auditory learning tools and techniques in our teaching and research work. Moreover, the workshop will facilitate an exchange among participants on opportunities and challenges of integrating sonic media in 1) a research communication strategy, and 2) a toolbox of learning activities for the classroom. |Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Alice Srugies, U of Gothenburg",,,,,,,

In the domain of public health, this literature has suggested that app-use can be seen as both a barrier and enablers for sexual health promotion, STI and HIV disclosures, testing and treatment. Within the fields of media, communication and cultural studies, work addressing LGBTQ+ men’s app use has primarily explored new conceptualisations of digital intimacy (Chan 2017; Møller & Petersen 2018; Race 2015; Roth 2012) and user understandings of queer space (Batiste 2013; Blackwell et al. 2015; Crooks 2013; Miles 2017; Roth 2014; 2015; Tudor 2012). Recent studies of app use among LGBTQ+ women have explored user experiences of the space alongside app affordances (Duguay 2016; 2019; Duguay et al. 2016; Ferris & Duguay 2019), the use of Hong Kong lesbian-focused app Butterfly (Choy 2017), and the queer-friendly Chinese app Momo (Liu 2016). Pond & Farvid (2017) highlighted stigma faced by bisexual women on Tinder. Literature specifically addressing trans and gender-fluid people’s use of dating apps is currently limited to health-focused research, and accounts drawing on app-users’ lived experience are lacking. Across media, communication and cultural studies research into LGBTQ+ people’s use of apps, only few researchers have centred user understandings and negotiations of app safety. This literature tends to address issues of personal safety as opposed to sexual health or sexual negotiation (Albury & Byron 2016; Davis et al. 2016; Pond & Farvid 2017). The papers in this panel are thematically linked by their attention to the differences between the ways that app designers and marketers seek to interact with and shape LGBTQ+ cultural practices, and the ways app users exceed and challenge the cultural discourses offered to them. Labor and Robards explore the ways app users negotiate sexuality, friendship, identity and community in very different sociocultural and religious settings of the Philippines and Australia. Duguay interrogates HER’s attempts to export a ‘Silicon Valley ideal’ of queer sociality to a global market of app users. Thompson reflects on Toronto trans and non-binary users’ experiences of ‘making do’ with limited or restricted access to both online and offline queer spaces. Warfield considers the ways that Bumble’s platform design and affordances restrict and enable bisexual self-representation, and Albury examines app users’ contradictory accounts of ‘negotiating safety’ to consider what ‘safer app use’ might look like to differently sexed and gendered users. The panel is united by a focus on the specific - and contested- cultural contexts in which app use intersects with queer sexualities and identities. |Co-Sponsorship:Mobile Communication|Additional Information:","Chairs: Anthony McCosker, Swinburne U of Technology","Beyond Hooking up on Hook-Up Apps: Friendship, Connectedness, and Community for Young LGBTIQ+ Australians",8:00 AM,8:00 AM,B.

In the domain of public health, this literature has suggested that app-use can be seen as both a barrier and enablers for sexual health promotion, STI and HIV disclosures, testing and treatment. Within the fields of media, communication and cultural studies, work addressing LGBTQ+ men’s app use has primarily explored new conceptualisations of digital intimacy (Chan 2017; Møller & Petersen 2018; Race 2015; Roth 2012) and user understandings of queer space (Batiste 2013; Blackwell et al. 2015; Crooks 2013; Miles 2017; Roth 2014; 2015; Tudor 2012). Recent studies of app use among LGBTQ+ women have explored user experiences of the space alongside app affordances (Duguay 2016; 2019; Duguay et al. 2016; Ferris & Duguay 2019), the use of Hong Kong lesbian-focused app Butterfly (Choy 2017), and the queer-friendly Chinese app Momo (Liu 2016). Pond & Farvid (2017) highlighted stigma faced by bisexual women on Tinder. Literature specifically addressing trans and gender-fluid people’s use of dating apps is currently limited to health-focused research, and accounts drawing on app-users’ lived experience are lacking. Across media, communication and cultural studies research into LGBTQ+ people’s use of apps, only few researchers have centred user understandings and negotiations of app safety. This literature tends to address issues of personal safety as opposed to sexual health or sexual negotiation (Albury & Byron 2016; Davis et al. 2016; Pond & Farvid 2017). The papers in this panel are thematically linked by their attention to the differences between the ways that app designers and marketers seek to interact with and shape LGBTQ+ cultural practices, and the ways app users exceed and challenge the cultural discourses offered to them. Labor and Robards explore the ways app users negotiate sexuality, friendship, identity and community in very different sociocultural and religious settings of the Philippines and Australia. Duguay interrogates HER’s attempts to export a ‘Silicon Valley ideal’ of queer sociality to a global market of app users. Thompson reflects on Toronto trans and non-binary users’ experiences of ‘making do’ with limited or restricted access to both online and offline queer spaces. Warfield considers the ways that Bumble’s platform design and affordances restrict and enable bisexual self-representation, and Albury examines app users’ contradictory accounts of ‘negotiating safety’ to consider what ‘safer app use’ might look like to differently sexed and gendered users. The panel is united by a focus on the specific - and contested- cultural contexts in which app use intersects with queer sexualities and identities. |Co-Sponsorship:Mobile Communication|Additional Information:","Chairs: Anthony McCosker, Swinburne U of Technology",Not Too Queer to Be Straight and Not Too Straight to Be Queer: Becoming Bisexual Through the Screen of Digital Hook-Up App Bumble,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,K.

The Sports Communication Playing Field: Leading International Scholars Consider the Research Agenda,Panel Session,Sports Communication,22-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,CC G HALL 1 - MULLET (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Since the 1980s, the scholarly focus on communication and sport has grown slowly but surely in communication, media, and sport studies. While receiving early warm reception in the sociology of sport, the research area more slowly and incrementally received legitimation on the scholarly terrain of communication. Now with three scholarly journals focused on the area of inquiry, the coming of a freestanding scholarly organization, the International Association for Communication and Sport, and the formation of interest groups, divisions, and sections across all major communication and media studies scholarly organizations, the study of communication and sport has clearly arrived on the disciplinary playing field of communication. Featuring leading established scholars on communication and sport from around the globe, this roundtable panel considers the development and future of research and the research community for an area of inquiry that is widely recognized to have social and cultural importance. The panel considers key questions about (1) the obstacles, past and present, that may continue to hinder development, (2) the strengths and weaknesses of the present research agenda, and (3) the priorities for future research on communication and sport and strategies for future institutional and scholarly development that will strengthen the impact of research on the scholarly terrain of communication and media studies. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Mike Devlin, Texas State U;Moderator: Lawrence Wenner, Loyola Marymount U;Participant: Andrew Billings, The U of Alabama;Participant: Marie Hardin, Pennsylvania State U;Participant: Toby Miller, Universidad de La Frontera;Participant: David Rowe, Western Sydney University;Participant: Kirsten Frandsen, Aarhus U;Participant: Alina Bernstein, College of Management Academic Studies (COMAS);Participant: Toni Bruce, University of Auckland;Participant: Xavier Ramon, U Pompeu Fabra;Participant: Ana Carolina Vimieiro, Federal University of Minas Gerais;Participant: Tzu-hsuan Chen, National Taiwan Sport U;Participant: Daniel Nölleke, U of Vienna;Participant: Jacco von Sterkenburg, Erasmus University",,,,,,,

Going One-to-One is Easier Said than Done: Understanding Technology Use in Educational Settings,Panel Session,Instructional and Developmental Communication,22-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,CC G HALL 3 - MULLET (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The use of digital technology in classroom environments has increased around the world, yet we know surprisingly little about how preK-5 teachers are incorporating this technology into their instructional practice. Research has documented that teachers have access to technology, yet many teachers report that they lack the skills and professional development experiences necessary to confidently and effectively use technology as a teaching tool in their classrooms (CSM, 2019; Pila, Blackwell, Lauricella, & Wartella, 2019). Despite the vast access and use of technology in formal school environments and extensive research in technology use in older grades (Harper & Millman, 2016), there is a lacuna of research on how teachers use technology within their instructional practices and how the digital devices themselves may support learning in classrooms with young children specifically. This international panel brings together interdisciplinary experts to present multi-method data on how teachers are using technology in their instruction with young students. The panel starts out with broad focus group data from parents and teachers as their school district introduced a 1:1 tablet program for all kindergarteners. Parents and teachers alike saw the opportunities of tablet technology but expressed concerns over how the school district and homes would be able to support children’s effective use of the devices. Our next two studies examine teachers’ use of technology by investigating from within the classrooms with a specific interest in how teachers in the United States and Australia incorporate technology into their pedagogy. Our final two presentations include more specific analyses into contexts in which technology influences students directly. We demonstrate that preschool teachers' scaffolding behavior varies as a function of platform and provide evidence that both confirms and challenges the commonly held assumption that educational technologies are empowering for special needs students and teachers. This panel pulls together diverse methodologies (experimental, survey, interview, observational, and case studies) to document the ways in which teachers serving diverse student populations use technology in the classroom as an instructional tool and how technology use influences teacher interaction and engagement. The panel further brings to light challenges that educators must overcome to successfully integrate technology into their pedagogy. Results from this panel can be used to inform best practices for successfully integrating instructional technology into school settings in a way that truly facilitates a more meaningful learning environment. |Co-Sponsorship:Children, Adolescents and the Media|Additional Information:","Chairs: Alexis Lauricella, Erikson Institute;Discussant: Sarah Pila, Northwestern U",Preparing Parents and Teachers for One-To-One Tablet Use in Kindergarten Classrooms,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,F.

"Public Relations Approaches to Algorithmic Accountability: Engagement, Trust, and Legitimation in the Age of AI",Panel Session,Public Relations,22-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 1 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The growing public concern about artificial intelligence(s) as well as their black boxing raise the question of how organizations are to account for their critical processes and conse-quences. The mounting public unease about the massive societal ramifications of autono-mous systems has perpetuated a public discourse that is increasingly concerned with their transparency and accountability, and has recently resulted in significant political interventions (Mittelstadt 2016; Pasquale, 2010). While this has become a main focus in fields such as computer science (Datta, Sen and Zick, 2017), journalism studies (Diakopoulos, 2015), law (Doshi-Velez, and Kortz, 2017), and media studies (Sandvig et al., 2014,) research in public relations has so far only sporadically addressed it. In this panel, we want to explore public relations perspectives on artificial intelligence(s), understood as a technology in practice, involving the interplay of different actors, institutions and relationships, and their sometimes conflicting perspectives, interactions and associations, emergent understandings, and nonlinear dynamics. As such, we regard the development and deployment of AI as fraught with radical uncertainty, both through the fluidity of AI and emergent and dynamic stakeholder expectations about AI accountability, and the challenges of actors to comprehensively identify, define, and contextualize ramifications. We think that due to the inherent opacity of these new technologies, there are a number of challenges to address for public relations, such as potential inequalities emerging from the implementation of AI both to end users, businesses and third parties, potential distrust emerging through these implementations, and the fundamental challenges of algorithmic opacity that may potentially overburden established ideals and processes of open and demo-cratic societies. To this end, the panel will provide four input contributions, followed by an interactive session meant to bring interested public relations scholars together and to formulate a research agenda. Proposed Schedule of the Panel The panel is designed for high levels of dialogue and openness, both between the panellists and the audience and between the individual contributions within the panel. Introduction (5 minutes) The panel will start with a short introduction by the panel organizer, offering a summary of its purpose and structure. The speakers will be briefly introduced. Contributions and Response (45 minutes) The four contributions will be presented in the order of the program. Each presentation has a strict time limit of 10 minutes. After the presentations, the respondent will summarize and contextualize all contributions in 5 minutes. Interactive Discussion (25 minutes) 25 minutes are reserved for interactive discussion. The panel will be opened to the audience, which is encouraged to participate in the discussion and add their perspectives. The discussion will be moderated by the panel organizer and respondent, paying attention to inclusivity and dialogue (e.g., distributing questions evenly across the panellists, avoiding that one panellist dominates the debate). The discussion serves to explore a PR-oriented research agenda on algorithmic accountability.|Co-Sponsorship:Communication and the Technology|Additional Information:","Participant: Shannon Bowen, U of South Carolina;Participant: Eliane Bucher, BI Norwegian Business School;Participant: Alexander Buhmann, BI Norwegian Business School;Chairs: Christian Fieseler, Norwegian Business School BI;Participant: Simon Hegelich, Technical University Munich;Participant: Andrea Hickerson, University of South Carolina;Participant: Christoph Lutz, BI Norwegian Business School;Participant: Miriam Meckel, U of St. Gallen;Participant: Chiara Valentini, U of Jyväskylä;Discussant: Ansgar Zerfass, Leipzig U",Responsibility Attributions in the Age of Algorithmization,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,C.

Confronting Ethnic/Racial/Indigenous/Minority Hatred in the Media,Panel Session,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,22-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:In the last five years, a growing number of people across the world have voted and are continuing to vote for leaders who stoke hatred against minorities and other oppressed groups, defame the opposition and dissenters, wave the flag of an aggressive and exclusionary nationalism, and advocate belligerent militarism against other nations. As a result, there has been a steady rise of polarizing, false and manipulative discourses against racial, ethnic, religious and other minority communities globally. These discourses are particularly embraced by leaders hoping to fan the flames of ethnic nationalism to benefit their political careers and prolong their stay in positions of power. Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 by tapping into fears that the United States was being invaded by Mexicans and Muslims (Cederman, 2019). Specifically in the US, since Trump’s presidential campaign started and his racialized political rhetoric saw the light of day, the number of incidents involving hate crimes has increased in the country. Hate crime incidents rose by 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 (FBI, 2018). Similarly, with the re-election of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister of India in May 2019, hate crimes against Muslims have soared there. But even as hate crimes occur with more frequency, the media, for the most part, tend to treat them as individual problems, not as systemic problems. This panel of international scholars seeks to untangle what we know about how news media in different countries are tackling coverage of hate and the representation of minorities against whom these acts of hate are perpetrated. The four papers in this panel look at hate from different perspectives in different regions of the world. Sudeshna Roy analyzes the media strategies of articulation of the aftermath of the shooting in El Paso, Texas, in August 2019, in which 22 people lost their lives. The shooter, by his own admission, primarily targeted Mexican immigrants to the US. Mohan Dutta unpacks and compares how racist hate circulates in digital media networks in India, Singapore and New Zealand. Daya Thussu examines the economic and political dimensions of a majoritarian media discourse promoting a muscular nationalism in India. Miriam Hernández compares the Brazilian and Mexican media coverage of hate crimes against LGBT members, countries with the highest rates of LGBT hate crimes in the world and where national and state leaders have openly voiced homophobe comments and opposed LGBT rights. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Sudeshna Roy, Stephen F.

From the USA to Australia, Brazil to the UK and Europe, highly racialized public debates focus on migration and women’s rights. This panel examines the possibilities and challenges for anti-racist and feminist media activism across a range of diverse contexts, media forms and modes of organising. While rapidly changing media technologies and platforms have enabled a proliferation of diverse and dissenting voices, what are the opportunities and challenges for media and social justice (Dreher et al 2017)? The panel foregrounds the achievement of media solidarities and political action, as well as exploring the pitfalls of commodification and co-optation in the digital media environment. The panel includes presentations on a diverse range of communicative activism, including Black women’s collective organising in Europe, intersectionality in digital media, racism and anti-racism in social media in Finland, anti-racism media in Brazil and Finland, and refugee themed media in Australia. Papers highlight solidarities in communication practices and advocacy campaigns, across socio-historical differences, and everyday knowledges and practices of intersectionality. These examples are analysed by mobilising theories of intersectionality, witnessing, solidarity and media activism, in order to unpack the complex challenges for social justice communication at a time of rapid media and political change. How are the claims of Black women’s organising and concerns for ‘women’s rights’ co-opted or weaponised in media debates on migration and feminism? How does intersectionality travel in digital media spaces? How can mediated witnessing be mobilised towards solidarity in difference?

This panel examines the possibilities and challenges for anti-racist and feminist media activism across a range of diverse contexts, media forms and modes of organising. While rapidly changing media technologies and platforms have enabled a proliferation of diverse and dissenting voices, what are the opportunities and challenges for media and social justice (Dreher et al 2017)? The panel foregrounds the achievement of media solidarities and political action, as well as exploring the pitfalls of commodification and co-optation in the digital media environment. The panel includes presentations on a diverse range of communicative activism, including Black women’s collective organising in Europe, intersectionality in digital media, racism and anti-racism in social media in Finland, anti-racism media in Brazil and Finland, and refugee themed media in Australia. Papers highlight solidarities in communication practices and advocacy campaigns, across socio-historical differences, and everyday knowledges and practices of intersectionality. These examples are analysed by mobilising theories of intersectionality, witnessing, solidarity and media activism, in order to unpack the complex challenges for social justice communication at a time of rapid media and political change. How are the claims of Black women’s organising and concerns for ‘women’s rights’ co-opted or weaponised in media debates on migration and feminism? How does intersectionality travel in digital media spaces? How can mediated witnessing be mobilised towards solidarity in difference?

Researching Dangerous and/or Difficult to Access Organizations: Insights From Experts in the Field,Panel Session,Organizational Communication,22-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Broadbeach 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Amid a general bias for openness and transparency in our society (see special issue by Hansen, Christensen, & Flyverbom, 2015), it is not surprising that we as organizational communication scholars have historically focused predominantly on large for-profit businesses, governmental agencies, and a few high-profile nonprofits/NGOs. This focus contributes to a lack of awareness and a lack of research on an entire range of “other” less-visible, but often highly-consequential, organizations. Scott (2015) argues that one of the reasons for this is that existing methods privilege some organizations over others. Thus, if accessing certain populations or organizations is perceived as too difficult or dangerous, many will pursue more convenient samples and cases. When organizational communication scholars do want to conduct research in, on, or about these “other” organizations, limited guidance from experts within our field is available. Instead, we often turn to work in sociology, criminology, security studies, or other disciplines—which rarely considers some of the relevant organizational and communication challenges we face in our field. As a result of all this, there has been a lack of research on these difficult to access and/or dangerous organizations and their members from a communicative perspective—making them the most poorly understood and in the greatest need of empirical study. This panel addresses these challenges by bringing together organizational communication experts from multiple institutions and countries conducting research in, on, and about a wide range of dangerous and/or difficult to access organizations. This includes work conducted in conflict/war zones, prisons/jails, and other challenging contexts—and examines issues related to human trafficking, bullying, secret/hidden organizations, terrorism, human rights, and more. Following a brief introduction by the session chair, each panelist will take 5-6 minutes to formally share some of their experiences, conceptual and methodological insights, and best practices for conducting this type of research. We will then engage with audience members about their own challenges or questions in doing this type of work. Additionally, in the spirit of the broader conference theme, we will “open” up the panel beyond those just attending the conference in Australia by inviting questions from the international organizational communication community (through the division’s email list) about this issue. We will then attempt to answer key questions at the panel as a way to surface additional challenges and be responsive to issues facing other researchers. Sending out the invitation for questions will also help promote attendance at the panel itself. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Oana Albu, U of Southern Denmark;Participant: Kirsten Foot, U of Washington;Participant: Brittany Peterson, Ohio University;Moderator: Craig Scott, Rutgers U;Participant: Michael Stohl, U of California, Santa Barbara;Participant: Sarah Tracy, Arizona State U",Researching Dangerous and/or Difficult to Access Organizations: Insights From Experts in the Field,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,C.

Urban Ethnography and Communication: Opening Up the Digital City for Research,Panel Session,Communication and Technology,22-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Southport 3 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Despite recent publications in urban communication and urban media studies (Aiello and Tosoni, 2016; Tosoni, Krajina and Ridell, 2019; Krajina and Stevenson, 2020), the method of urban ethnography is still rather under-explored in communication research. This panel brings together researchers who use urban ethnography to examine the digital city through changes in communication, local power and politics, and existing inequalities. The “digital city” refers to how digital technologies become embedded within and shape the material and social fabric of the city (Mitchell, 2000). Spanning a diverse set of cities such as Chicago, Bengaluru, London, Los Angeles, Kansas City, and Glasgow, the panelists discuss how mobile technologies, smart infrastructures, the platform economy, and data analytics circulate local stories, open up novel communication avenues, manufacture urban environments, and obfuscate and amplify longstanding divides in the city. The panel offers three main interventions. First, all papers empirically trace the patterns in the tech industry’s intentional foray into urban environments over the last decade, while attending to how these interventions differ across the scales, political geographies, and aims under which they operate. Challenging both the tech-evangelist hype expressed by supporters of digital cities and the collective anxiety voiced by critics, panelists reveal the lived experiences of violence, commodification, mundanity, serendipity, and racism, which are interwoven with digital sociality in the city. Second, all papers reflect on what is at stake in centering place-based methods in studying communication and technology. Ethnography is well-designed to study the localization of global technological trends, in conjunction with approaches like computation and document analysis. The projects show how the ostensibly universal claims of digital technologies interact with the politics and culture of each local environment to shape the lives of urban residents. Finally, in tandem with this year’s conference theme, panelists discuss their ideas of opening up the city for research. As ethnographers, we reflect on our responsibility to share and produce knowledge with the communities we work with. We also discuss the challenges of studying technologies, platforms, and data analytics that are often obscured from observation and enveloped in corporate software. Panelists, who are at various stages in their careers, have all been conducting ethnographic research in digitally mediated cities for the last few years. They draw on and contribute to an interdisciplinary literature of communication, media studies, STS, information science, critical data studies, and geography.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Best Practices for Conducting Ethical Research With Children,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,22-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:One ethical issue that scholars face when working with children is informed consent. To ensure that decision making is autonomous, researchers must attend to three main elements of the informed consent process—adequate information, voluntariness, and capacity to understand information as presented. Responsibility for child consent is vested in parents and guardians, who are assumed to have the best interests of the child in mind. Very little empirical research exists on assent to research with children. This is especially true with respect to what circumstances Review Boards determine whether assent is required, how researchers should solicit child assent, what children comprehend in various types of research, and what predicts successful assent procedures. All of these issues are further complicated when the population of children come from marginalized communities. For example, children from under-served communities or from lower socio-economic households may be incentivized to participate in a study to earn a gift card, rather than their willingness to participate. Children with a disability may be unable to voice their assent or dissent in research, even though parents may have given permission. And children who are native English speakers may not fully comprehend the research process at all. Therefore, this workshop aims to address these issues while also tackling a number of other important, related questions: • What implications do laws and regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have on research with children and parental consent? • When is it appropriate to seek a waiver of consent/permission or assent for children and parents? • How do researchers balance the privacy rights of the child with the rights of the parent/guardian? We hope this Blue Sky workshop will provide a forum for students and scholars to connect and share their experiences in doing research with children, with specific attention to children from marginalized populations. We believe that the panel we have organized represents some of the very best our division has to offer its members and ICA at large when thinking about this complicated and important issue. |Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:Children, Adolescents and the Media|Additional Information:","Discussant: Bradley Bond, U of San Diego;Discussant: Dina Borzekowski, U of Maryland;Discussant: Vikki Katz, Rutgers University ;Discussant: Agnes Lucy Lando, Daystar U;Chairs: Nicole Martins, Indiana U;Chairs: Cecilia Zhou, U of Massachusetts Amherst",Best Practices for Conducting Ethical Research With Children,3:30 PM,3:30 PM,N.

Deconstructing ‘Diversity’ and the Politics of Race in the Australian and British Creative and Cultural Industries,Panel Session,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,22-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Across Western cultural and creative industries (CCIs) the topic of ‘diversity’ is high on the policy agenda. ‘Diversity’ discourse in the context of Western CCIs is underpinned by a broadly multicultural politics that appears inclusive, yet very rarely mentions race let alone racism. In response this panel seeks to move beyond a notion of ‘diversity’ as an approach that can legitimately address social injustice. Rather its starting point is that the language of ‘diversity’ acts as a form of racial governance that claims to meet the demands of minorities while keeping hierarchies of race in place (Malik, 2013; Gray, 2015; Saha, 2018). The UK and Australia make interesting cases to compare, as both nations have a strong tradition of multicultural policy in the arts and cultural sector that has attempted to give voice to its minority populations in order to create a sense of national community. Moreover, it was in these two countries were where what is known as ‘Creative Industries’ policy was first established, from which the current ‘diversity’ paradigm emerges. Another similarity that Australia and the UK share are their brutal (yet distinct) histories of racism and colonialism, the legacies of which still shape national politics and in turn, the way that ‘diversity’ is understood and operationalised. Each of the papers in this panel tackle different facets of diversity in particular cultural contexts. Rimi Khan’s paper considers the underpresentation of racial and ethnic minority artists in Australia and how cultural policy has failed to address this primarily due to a refusal to frame its approach in terms of race and racism. Anamik Saha in a study of the UK publishing industry considers how different and at times contradictory discourses around diversity shape the making of writers of colour, often in reductive and damaging ways. Sandra Phillips also looks at trade publishing, though in this case focusing on the publication of Indigenous writers in Australia who struggle for recognition within the core publishing industry despite notable commercial successes. Clive Nwonka examines UK film policy and how its concerted attempts to quantify and monitor ‘diversity’ has in fact achieved little in addressing the racial and ethnic inequalities that define the sector.

The roundtable comprises three inter-related sets of papers, with each author providing a brief synopses of their research. The first set of presentations address structures of disinformation and violence in digital communication in millennial India, and foreground new forms of digital activism that have emerged through community projects to resist them. Presenters emphasize a contextual approach to global digital politics, and seek to show how digital avenues have become a key condition for social justice and political inclusion in the global South. The second set of presentations focus on the May 2019 national election victory of Narendra Modi’s party. Authors in this section of the roundtable will analyse what the implications are of Modi's win and his use of social media to India’s changing democracy, the rise of nationalism and the role of digital media. The final set of presentations examine how right-wing nationalism is becoming pervasive across the world. On the one hand, media--especially social media--plays a central role in enabling logics of such nationalism. On the other hand, ""liberal"" media (or whatever remains of it) often seems unable to fully comprehend, or connect to, emerging nationalist populist sentiments on the ground. This panel will examine the relation between media and contemporary (especially right wing populist) nationalism, and includes analysis of the communication strategies of right-wing leaders in India, Turkey, and the United States. |Additional Information:","Moderator: Shakuntala Rao, State U of New York, Plattsburgh",Games Politicians Play: The NaMo app and the Indian Election of 2019,3:30 PM,3:30 PM,K.

The final set of presentations examine how right-wing nationalism is becoming pervasive across the world. On the one hand, media--especially social media--plays a central role in enabling logics of such nationalism. On the other hand, ""liberal"" media (or whatever remains of it) often seems unable to fully comprehend, or connect to, emerging nationalist populist sentiments on the ground. This panel will examine the relation between media and contemporary (especially right wing populist) nationalism, and includes analysis of the communication strategies of right-wing leaders in India, Turkey, and the United States. |Additional Information:","Moderator: Shakuntala Rao, State U of New York, Plattsburgh",“The Left is the enemy”: Propaganda and user participations in hashtag nationalism,3:30 PM,3:30 PM,S.

Political Communication in 2020: Assessing the State of the Field,Panel Session,Political Communication,22-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,CC G HALL 2 - MULLET (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:200|400-word Panel Rationale:In the face of rapid changes in both media and politics, it is vital that we take time to assess the state of the field of political communication. This panel at the 2020 ICA provides a forum for that assessment as it is designed to reflect on and take stock of significant accomplishments, discuss the big questions that should be animating our research, and identify the challenges facing political communication research in various critical areas. Specifically, this panel will provide a venue for discussion and evaluations which seeks to speak to the following questions: What are the big questions and challenges facing political communication research? How are we addressing key research questions in a rapidly changing media and political environment? What are we doing well and what should we be doing? Are there questions or issues we should be addressing that have not received enough attention in the field or in your particular research area? Are our methods adequate to the work that needs to be done? Do we need new theories? How can our research make an impact? What should the agenda be for political communication research over the next decade? This panel brings together scholars at various stages in their careers working on significant topics in the field. These scholars are well positioned to provide assessments of the state of research in key areas, talk about where they see the field going, and speak to the barriers and opportunities they see in the field. Scholars will offer short presentations leaving plenty of time for audience discussion, questions and participation. Panelists and topics will include: Cristian Vaccari – Comparative Political Communication Research Ashley Muddiman – Incivility Phil Howard – Disinformation, Computational Propaganda Emily Vraga – Misinformation Judith Moller – AI, Algorithms and Tailored Communication through Social Media Tetsuro Kobayashi – Political Communication Research in Asia Stuart Soroka or Kevin Arceneaux – Biology, Affect and Political Communication |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Kimberly Gross, George Washington U;Participant: Philip Howard, Oxford University;Participant: Tetsuro Kobayashi, City U of Hong Kong;Participant: Judith Moeller, U of Amsterdam;Participant: Ashley Muddiman, U of Kansas;Participant: Stuart Soroka, U of Michigan;Participant: Cristian Vaccari, Loughborough U;Participant: Emily Vraga, U of Minnesota",,,,,,,

South Asian studies have been dominated by the disciplines of anthropology, history, folklore, and other much older allied sub-disciplines in the humanities. Media, communication and journalism studies are still relative newcomers to this global interdisciplinary formation of South Asian studies. Addressing their specific areas of research on South Asia, whether it be journalism, feminist media studies, digital media and culture, information infrastructures, documentary and film genres, or health communication, to name a few, panelists will share the contributions, scope and status of their sub-fields in the regions of the world in which they are situated. In addition, they will also identify and discuss the challenges, joys, and opportunities of doing research on (and in) South Asia in the broader academic fields of media, communication and journalism studies. What are the struggles we face in getting our work reviewed and published? How have we navigated and found solutions to some of these challenges? How do we confront and resolve the dangers of getting secluded as “area studies” scholars, and at the same time make unique contributions to the field? How can we work together to create a better and more inclusive climate for research on South Asia? Finally, what are the unique opportunities that current and future scholars can take advantage of by focusing the scholarship on one of the largest and fastest growing parts of the globe? With over one-fourth of the world’s population, South Asia has emerged as an important region for politics, security, health communication, culture, media and other relevant issues across the repertoire of our field. The South Asia Communication Association (SACA) represents a joint effort of media and communication scholars and practitioners in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora worldwide. We constituted SACA in 2015 at San Francisco as an umbrella organization with a presence in a number of different organizations and their conferences. The SACA members comprise teachers, scholars, researchers and professionals who examine the media and communication practices of the nine-county region of South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and the South Asian diaspora worldwide. SACA members may constitute people with research interest in any of these nine nations or the South Asian diaspora worldwide.

"Aggressive Emotion, Precarious Labour and Colonial Continuities: Theoretical Debates on Online Extreme Speech",Panel Session,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique",23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Stradbroke Room - Session (Star Pool Level),"Expected Attendance:100|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel contributes to debates around online vitriol and disinformation by advancing theoretical insights into aspects of emotionality, political economy and cultural variation in a contextually rooted and historically sensitive global framework. Taking the conversations beyond transatlantic concerns around “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers”, and the underlying assumptions of technological determinism and presentism, the panel brings a set of theoretical reflections that overcome the limitations of “hate speech” and “populist leadership” explanations in understanding these developments. In so doing, the panel engages with the theory of “extreme speech”, in particular to turn the normative and regulatory question of classifying and isolating hate speech and disinformation into an analytical exercise to understand how this phenomenon has come about (Udupa & Pohjonen, 2019; Udupa, Gagliardone & Hervik, forthcoming). In the first contribution, Jayson Harsin highlights “conjuncturally specific emotionality” of post-truth politics. In a novel theoretical move, he pins down post-truth politics to the epistemological role of emotionality, and how “emotions perform an indexical relationship to truth”, which is similar to relationship between truth, trust and emotions in promotional and entertainment cultures. Sahana Udupa further develops the arguments about affective infrastructures of digital circulation, and grounds this discussion within histories of white supremacy and colonialism. She emphasizes the need for a decolonial move that takes into account historical continuities underpinning affective intensities around imaginary wounds. Such a decolonial move will also advance a methodological agenda that acknowledges multiple contexts of political cultures, situated speech and global technocultures that lie behind the current conjuncture. Jonathan Corpus Ong and Jason Vincent Cabanes turn to questions of political economy, precisely in recognition of these multiple contexts. Similar to Jason Harsin’s emphasis on entertainment cultures, they highlight the logics of cultural industries, but with a sharpened focus on the production dynamics of disinformation work. Highlighting the moral conundrums faced by disinsformation workers, they suggest that ethnography entails an empathetic approach to understand their precarious working conditions. However, this does not necessarily mean jettisoning the normative critique of lack of ethics and accountability. Further reflecting on the challenges of positioning a normative critique, Matti Pohjonen adopts a meta-view of the “hate speech” discourse. Online hate speech, he argues, is an “order word” that comes with a normative injunction, and is largely used to enable strategic interventions. Through this meta-critique, he reemphasizes the merits of adopting a comparative ethnographic study advocated by extreme speech theory. The panel seeks to advance a much-needed theoretical conversation about multiple contexts of political cultures, historical forces and political economy, in order to develop robust toolsets to critique contemporary forms of extreme speech. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Jayson Harsin, The American U of Paris;Participant: Jonathan Ong, U of Massachusetts Amherst;Participant: Matti Pohjonen, SOAS, U of London;Chairs: Sahana Udupa, LMU Munich;Participant: Sahana Udupa, LMU Munich;Discussant: Barbie Zelizer, U of Pennsylvania","Aggro-Truth: Aggressive Emotion, Popular Culture, and Post-Truth Politics",11:00 AM,11:00 AM,J.

The panel seeks to advance a much-needed theoretical conversation about multiple contexts of political cultures, historical forces and political economy, in order to develop robust toolsets to critique contemporary forms of extreme speech. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Jayson Harsin, The American U of Paris;Participant: Jonathan Ong, U of Massachusetts Amherst;Participant: Matti Pohjonen, SOAS, U of London;Chairs: Sahana Udupa, LMU Munich;Participant: Sahana Udupa, LMU Munich;Discussant: Barbie Zelizer, U of Pennsylvania",Beyond “Regressive Rancor”: Continuities and Multiplicities in Online Extreme Speech,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,S.

Taking the conversations beyond transatlantic concerns around “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers”, and the underlying assumptions of technological determinism and presentism, the panel brings a set of theoretical reflections that overcome the limitations of “hate speech” and “populist leadership” explanations in understanding these developments. In so doing, the panel engages with the theory of “extreme speech”, in particular to turn the normative and regulatory question of classifying and isolating hate speech and disinformation into an analytical exercise to understand how this phenomenon has come about (Udupa & Pohjonen, 2019; Udupa, Gagliardone & Hervik, forthcoming). In the first contribution, Jayson Harsin highlights “conjuncturally specific emotionality” of post-truth politics. In a novel theoretical move, he pins down post-truth politics to the epistemological role of emotionality, and how “emotions perform an indexical relationship to truth”, which is similar to relationship between truth, trust and emotions in promotional and entertainment cultures. Sahana Udupa further develops the arguments about affective infrastructures of digital circulation, and grounds this discussion within histories of white supremacy and colonialism. She emphasizes the need for a decolonial move that takes into account historical continuities underpinning affective intensities around imaginary wounds. Such a decolonial move will also advance a methodological agenda that acknowledges multiple contexts of political cultures, situated speech and global technocultures that lie behind the current conjuncture. Jonathan Corpus Ong and Jason Vincent Cabanes turn to questions of political economy, precisely in recognition of these multiple contexts. Similar to Jason Harsin’s emphasis on entertainment cultures, they highlight the logics of cultural industries, but with a sharpened focus on the production dynamics of disinformation work. Highlighting the moral conundrums faced by disinsformation workers, they suggest that ethnography entails an empathetic approach to understand their precarious working conditions. However, this does not necessarily mean jettisoning the normative critique of lack of ethics and accountability. Further reflecting on the challenges of positioning a normative critique, Matti Pohjonen adopts a meta-view of the “hate speech” discourse.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Losing My Religion: How to Build a Career Outside the Academy,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,23-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:As we begin the decade of the 2020s, higher education is on the verge of a crisis. Student loan debt has never been greater, the tenure track is giving way to the rise of the adjunct, online education is growing, and many middle tier private liberal arts colleges are going out of business. As the decade progresses, demographic trends will accelerate all of these factors. The US college applicant pool is estimated to shrink by approximately 280,000 per year starting in 2026, accelerating the implosion of an industry already in crisis. Some have predicted that as many as half of all universities will close or go bankrupt during the 2020s, prompting US News and World Report to announce that, “The higher education apocalypse is coming.” Thus, whether by choice or by circumstance, an increasing number of trained scholars will be seeking careers outside of the academy in the coming decade. Ranked by the placement of their graduates into tenure track positions, PhD programs are not incentivized to prepare their students for a non-academic career track. Meanwhile, PhD students have been acculturated by a previous generation of scholars who may not have networks or understand the realities of careers outside the academy. This can leave young scholars who do not move into a tenure track position feeling lost, abandoned and with a profound sense of failure that can hinder the realities of job hunting at a time when the first years outside of school can determine the shape of their entire career. This session will be led by a scholar who successfully moved from a PhD program into a full time faculty position and forward into a successful career outside the academy. It will furthermore draw from quotes and lessons learned from a broad cross-section of other scholars turned practitioners who may no longer be present on the academic conference circuit. This session will help scholars to reframe life outside the academy as an opportunity and provide key resources and strategies to begin realizing that opportunity to build a successful non-academic or academic-adjacent career. It will also provide a safe space and networking forum for scholars exploring the possibility of making the leap out of the academy. Attendees are encouraged to bring questions, concerns, confessions and a 1 page resume formatted for a nonacademic employer.|Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Paul Falzone, PVI",,,,,,,

The theoretical framework suggests that communicative inequalities are intertwined with structural inequalities, thus turning to building infrastructures for subaltern voices as the basis for social change. New frontiers of culture-centered interventions explore strategies for building communicative infrastructures in collaboration with subaltern communities, the challenges experienced in the work of co-creating these infrastructures, and the methodological openings for sustaining voice infrastructures that serve as entry points to structural transformation. Social change communication processes, grounded in voice, serve as the basis for building knowledge claims, movements, advocacy interventions, and material infrastructures. This panel, drawing on over two decades of culture-centered interventions developed in spaces in the global South, grapples with the tensions embodied in the work of disrupting structures through the co-creation of communication infrastructures for subaltern voices. In what is titled as the “frontiers of culture-centered interventions,” panel participants work through methodological and theoretical questions focused on the question of co-creating voice infrastructures. What does it mean to co-create voice infrastructures? What are the negotiations in the practices of co-creating communicative equality? The panel will draw on five areas of culture-centered scholarship: poverty; sex work; indigenous resistance; anti—racist interventions; and food security. In each of these areas of scholarship, panelists will explore the actual work of building voice infrastructures, asking the question: What does it mean for subaltern voices to be heard? Drawing on the notion that the methodological interventions in the CCA grapple with the question of learning to listen to subaltern voice, participants share collaboratively their experiences developing and implementing culture-centered interventions. The emerging threads in the panel will offer potential anchors for considering the nature of culture-centered interventions seeking to bring about structural transformations, with a specific focus on delineating what it means to have achieved structural transformation. Moreover, what are the ingredients necessary for achieving transformations in structures? How do communicative openings for voice lead to structural transformation? What are the processes for building communication infrastructures for voice? Each topic area on the panel brings together academics from across contexts working in the area, thus offering a rich anchor for theorizing the nature of culture-centered interventions. |Co-Sponsorship:Activism, Communication and Social Justice|Additional Information:","Discussant: Mohan Jyoti Dutta, Massey U;Chairs: Christine Elers, Massey U;Chairs: Pooja Jayan, Massey U",Poverty and Structural Transformation,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,A.

New Frontiers of the Culture-Centered Approach: Interventions Disrupting Structures,Panel Session,Health Communication,23-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,Star Southport 1 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:100|400-word Panel Rationale:The culture-centered approach (CCA) as a method for building communicative infrastructures for subaltern voice puts forth the argument that addressing health inequalities is fundamentally about disrupting structures. The theoretical framework suggests that communicative inequalities are intertwined with structural inequalities, thus turning to building infrastructures for subaltern voices as the basis for social change. New frontiers of culture-centered interventions explore strategies for building communicative infrastructures in collaboration with subaltern communities, the challenges experienced in the work of co-creating these infrastructures, and the methodological openings for sustaining voice infrastructures that serve as entry points to structural transformation. Social change communication processes, grounded in voice, serve as the basis for building knowledge claims, movements, advocacy interventions, and material infrastructures. This panel, drawing on over two decades of culture-centered interventions developed in spaces in the global South, grapples with the tensions embodied in the work of disrupting structures through the co-creation of communication infrastructures for subaltern voices. In what is titled as the “frontiers of culture-centered interventions,” panel participants work through methodological and theoretical questions focused on the question of co-creating voice infrastructures. What does it mean to co-create voice infrastructures? What are the negotiations in the practices of co-creating communicative equality? The panel will draw on five areas of culture-centered scholarship: poverty; sex work; indigenous resistance; anti—racist interventions; and food security. In each of these areas of scholarship, panelists will explore the actual work of building voice infrastructures, asking the question: What does it mean for subaltern voices to be heard? Drawing on the notion that the methodological interventions in the CCA grapple with the question of learning to listen to subaltern voice, participants share collaboratively their experiences developing and implementing culture-centered interventions. The emerging threads in the panel will offer potential anchors for considering the nature of culture-centered interventions seeking to bring about structural transformations, with a specific focus on delineating what it means to have achieved structural transformation. Moreover, what are the ingredients necessary for achieving transformations in structures? How do communicative openings for voice lead to structural transformation? What are the processes for building communication infrastructures for voice? Each topic area on the panel brings together academics from across contexts working in the area, thus offering a rich anchor for theorizing the nature of culture-centered interventions. |Co-Sponsorship:Activism, Communication and Social Justice|Additional Information:","Discussant: Mohan Jyoti Dutta, Massey U;Chairs: Christine Elers, Massey U;Chairs: Pooja Jayan, Massey U",Food,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,J.

"Dangerous Data and Queer Communication: Risk, Gender and Sexuality in Open Data Sharing",Panel Session,Feminist Scholarship,23-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Broadbeach 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:|400-word Panel Rationale:Opening up science can be emancipatory. If we can make science and scientific data more inclusive by making it freely available, the number and types of people who can access and engage in scientific inquiry could increase (Dai, Shin and Smith, 2018; Bezuidenhout et al. 2017). However, the reality of opening up science, particularly for marginalized and feminized individuals is complex. Queer, feminine and racialized bodies experience risks when they open up their science to the public (Okune et. al., 2018, Hodson et. al., 2018). For example, when Dr. Katie Bouman successfully captured the first image of a black hole, she was subject to online harassment simply because she was a woman (Resnick, 2019). Additionally, feminist and queer scholars who want to open up data have to contend with the ways oppressive structures are inscribed and reinforced through data cleaning and organization. For example, how might the act of making data intelligible through metadata classification make certain subjectivities visible or invisible? And finally, what role does open science play (or what role could it play) in the politics of citation (Ahmed, 2017)? This panel will take a queer and feminist approach to understanding the unique opportunities and risk posed by open science to women and marginalized scientists. Situating a critique of the current structures that reinforce existing inequalities (see for example, (Clauset, Arbesman, & Larremore, 2015; Gewinner, 2017; Ahmed, 2017), this panel will adopt an ecological understanding (Bronfenbrenner, 1994; Cukier et. al., 2014). Each paper examines the different structural, cultural, relational, and individual factors that influence one’s ability to open up science safely. Furthermore, we will explore how marginalized scholars resist the systems, structures and bad actors when they do open up their science despite threats of harassment. We ask: How do marginalized scientists perform a role when opening up their science to the public, and does the performance of open science help to mitigate some of the risks? Through an examination of 1) the entanglement of visibility and marginalization of open data sharing; 2) considerations of how peer review might be made more inclusive; 3) an investigation of the ways women are made responsible for their own data security, and then finally, 4) a discussion of how online harassment impacts women and marginalized scientists who wish to open up their science, this panel will provide a nuanced picture of risk, gender and sexuality with regards to open science. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Megan Brown;Participant: Sky Croeser, Curtin U;Moderator: Jaigris Hodson, Royal Roads U;Participant: Jaigris Hodson, Royal Roads U;Participant: Caitlin McGrane, RMIT U",Gendered Data Sharing: The Entanglement of Visibility and Marginalisation,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,C.

As critical cultural scholars, our intention has always been to engage with open communication not just as a critical and reflexive practice, but also to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and dialogue. At the core of this consideration, should be an analysis on the methodological choices we make that lend themselves to actively pursuing an open communication program that not only benefits communities we work with, but also offers future scholars’ opportunities to engage with research from outside of the Western canon. Communication scholars are disciplined to utilize existing and longstanding methodologies without question, in turn stifling opportunities to unmask, question, or reposition knowledge outside of what already exists in the world. In doing so, reproducing the unquestioned superiority of Western knowledge over all other forms of knowing. As such, the diverse group of panelists coming from different nations and cultures (i.e., Kuwait, Iran, Japan, Morocco, Taiwan, and U.S.) will discuss how to implement open communication strategies, by interrogating unquestioned methodologies, so that we may begin to address race and ethnicity through decolonized scholarship. Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s seminal work, Decolonizing Methodologies argues, that research has been a longstanding tool of European imperialism and colonialism used to further marginalize communities (1999). History’s long objectification of non-Western Others for the pursuit of research has led to the essentializing, silencing, and further marginalization of traditionally subjugated communities, and its history has remained in public memory (Smith, 1999). Decolonizing methodology (e.g., queer of color critique and performative writing) means reframing the centrality of Western knowledge, toward demystifying the notion that it is only one way to produce and reproduce knowledge. Decolonizing methodology means exposing longstanding, often unquestioned methodological practices, and instead making space for discovering knowledge from and with those who have insofar been historically objectified. Decolonizing methodology asks scholars to see those who have been historically othered’ not as subjects to study, but as knowledge producers, critical thinkers, and theorizers. In this panel, we argue that if open communication is the way to build better communication research, decolonizing methodologies is one tangible mode we can use to begin dismantling longstanding intellectual boundaries that ensure the reproduction of what has insofar been considered the only legitimate form of knowledge. Specifically, in this panel we address how decolonial methods can be used to address myriad issues surrounding race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and the body. Smith, L.T. (1999).

Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s seminal work, Decolonizing Methodologies argues, that research has been a longstanding tool of European imperialism and colonialism used to further marginalize communities (1999). History’s long objectification of non-Western Others for the pursuit of research has led to the essentializing, silencing, and further marginalization of traditionally subjugated communities, and its history has remained in public memory (Smith, 1999). Decolonizing methodology (e.g., queer of color critique and performative writing) means reframing the centrality of Western knowledge, toward demystifying the notion that it is only one way to produce and reproduce knowledge. Decolonizing methodology means exposing longstanding, often unquestioned methodological practices, and instead making space for discovering knowledge from and with those who have insofar been historically objectified. Decolonizing methodology asks scholars to see those who have been historically othered’ not as subjects to study, but as knowledge producers, critical thinkers, and theorizers. In this panel, we argue that if open communication is the way to build better communication research, decolonizing methodologies is one tangible mode we can use to begin dismantling longstanding intellectual boundaries that ensure the reproduction of what has insofar been considered the only legitimate form of knowledge. Specifically, in this panel we address how decolonial methods can be used to address myriad issues surrounding race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and the body. Smith, L.T. (1999).

How (Not) to Track an Election in a Digital Ecosystem: Lessons From Around the World,Panel Session,Political Communication,23-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Coolangatta 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:25|400-word Panel Rationale:In elections, political parties, journalists, civil society groups, and others all work to generate interest in, and awareness of, political issues and processes. Varied actors use multiple tools to share political messages as they venture to reach people, shift opinions, and get voters to the polls. Globally, elections take place in a digital ecosystem which encompases digital tools used to collect and share information such as social media, search engines, voter databases and accompanying interfaces and online news. Newly available data and opportunities for analysis surface with the use of these tools. Indeed, issues such as disinformation, use of private personal data, and attempts to infer public opinion from social media have surfaced in public policy discussions in multiple countries and in research. However, digital data is expensive, technically hard to collect and share, and access and use of this data is constantly changing because platforms (and how we use them) are constantly changing. Researchers need to share best practices to keep up. Rather than a typical set of papers, each of four panelists will present a key question for elections researchers. They will each present insights based on their own research before turning the question over to the other panelists for them to weigh in. In this way we facilitate an engaging discussion across areas of expertise. We bring together perspectives from researchers, journalists, other practitioners, and the public through four studies of elections in Canada, Brazil, India, and the U.S. Dubois begins by asking, What can, or should, we track during an election campaign? She draws on an 18 team research collaboration she lead during the 2019 Canadian election as a case. Bannerman asks, What is the impact of voters’ awareness of personal data used for election campaigns? She describes the perspective of Canadian voters’ relationships to political parties. Bradshaw asks, What are the technical and ethical challenges for researchers collecting data from private and encrypted platforms? She examines how WhatsApp is being used as a platform for contemporary political communication in Brazil and India. McGregor asks, How do digital data impact election reporting, how do audiences react, and who benefits from these emergent representations of public opinion? She uses the case of U.S. elections. Finally, Rossini will serve as respondent.

How (Not) to Track an Election in a Digital Ecosystem: Lessons From Around the World,Panel Session,Political Communication,23-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Coolangatta 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:25|400-word Panel Rationale:In elections, political parties, journalists, civil society groups, and others all work to generate interest in, and awareness of, political issues and processes. Varied actors use multiple tools to share political messages as they venture to reach people, shift opinions, and get voters to the polls. Globally, elections take place in a digital ecosystem which encompases digital tools used to collect and share information such as social media, search engines, voter databases and accompanying interfaces and online news. Newly available data and opportunities for analysis surface with the use of these tools. Indeed, issues such as disinformation, use of private personal data, and attempts to infer public opinion from social media have surfaced in public policy discussions in multiple countries and in research. However, digital data is expensive, technically hard to collect and share, and access and use of this data is constantly changing because platforms (and how we use them) are constantly changing. Researchers need to share best practices to keep up. Rather than a typical set of papers, each of four panelists will present a key question for elections researchers. They will each present insights based on their own research before turning the question over to the other panelists for them to weigh in. In this way we facilitate an engaging discussion across areas of expertise. We bring together perspectives from researchers, journalists, other practitioners, and the public through four studies of elections in Canada, Brazil, India, and the U.S. Dubois begins by asking, What can, or should, we track during an election campaign? She draws on an 18 team research collaboration she lead during the 2019 Canadian election as a case. Bannerman asks, What is the impact of voters’ awareness of personal data used for election campaigns? She describes the perspective of Canadian voters’ relationships to political parties. Bradshaw asks, What are the technical and ethical challenges for researchers collecting data from private and encrypted platforms? She examines how WhatsApp is being used as a platform for contemporary political communication in Brazil and India. McGregor asks, How do digital data impact election reporting, how do audiences react, and who benefits from these emergent representations of public opinion? She uses the case of U.S. elections. Finally, Rossini will serve as respondent.

A Global Analysis of Journalism Startups and Media Policy,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 2 (Star),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel examines media policy for journalism startups and digital-born organizations across a wide range of countries and media systems. It specifically explores how countries are dealing with a number of factors - such as declining legacy journalism economic models and tightly controlled political systems - asking what are the emerging policy options in a 21st century digital journalism landscape in which startups are now a global phenomenon. This panel brings together perspectives from journalism startups in Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands and Singapore to examine the lessons arising from different media policies, their implementation and business contexts for countries with similar commercial journalism systems and/or emergent startup landscapes. The range of national contexts surfaces how, in some cases, policy is intended to support and sustain the media as a business as well as a public good in an environment disrupted by digitalization, and in others is used as an instrument to support state control. For example, The Netherlands has subsidized startups, while in Canada, the federal government has taken the approach of allocating almost $600 million in funding to journalism organizations through labour tax credits and personal tax credits for news consumption. These approaches are novel as media economic policy has tended to focus on issues such as competition, local monopolies and ownership concentration, though increasingly it is being considered as an economic survival issue given the challenges facing legacy commercial media. Policies of economic subventions can be compared to approaches in India, with an increasingly hostile climate to the media, and Singapore, where the government is introducing policy to disadvantage digital startups as a way to decrease challenges to political hegemony. This panel explores: the role of media economic policy in the context of broader political debates on the role of journalism; economic considerations about whether a diverse media system should be left to the market or requires public support; whether journalism should be treated as a public good; and the role of policy interventions in setting the conditions for digital journalism startups. The cross-national range of the panel serves to highlight emerging global policy approaches.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Alfred Hermida, U of British Columbia",Media Policy and Digital Journalism Start-Ups in Australia,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,A.

Curiosity Killed the CAT? The Future of the Communication and Technology Division When Technology Permeates all Areas of Communication,Panel Session,Communication and Technology,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Southport 3 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Communication as a discipline has become more expansive in recent years - indeed, Silvio Waisbord’s Communication: A Post-Discipline argues that technology’s proliferation into every aspect of social life has exacerbated the lack of intellectual cohesion in Communication, blurring lines that have long given the field structure. In conversation with this year’s theme, we understand Open Communication to mean removing borders within the discipline and across traditional disciplinary boundaries. As we have seen the past few decades, the field has become increasingly “bordered,” perhaps best illustrated by ICA’s own proliferation of divisions and interest groups (from five divisions at its founding to 17 in 1998 and 24 at present, not including interest groups). On the micro level: where does the Communication and Technology (CAT) Division fit? Put another way: What makes CAT distinct if technology is relevant, perhaps integral, to most divisions and interest groups? Should it be a home for all scholarship that touches on the use of all forms of communication technology, or should it limit itself a narrower band of topics that wouldn’t fit into divisions that currently include technology-related scholarship? Where should authors send papers when there are often at least two divisions that would be suitable? An informal look at top papers in other divisions and interest groups for the last five years finds that at least half of the top papers could have also been submitted to and accepted by the CAT division. On a higher level, these same questions are relevant to the field. Does disciplining (and sub-disciplining) the field benefit scholarship by providing a community of scholars with a structural logic and focus on particular subjects, theories, methods, or does it limit the scope, reach and knowledge available to scholars? Topics other than technology may lend themselves to similar cross-cutting open conversations among divisions and interest groups; perhaps now is the time to consider a structure for the field that is based on other than traditional boundaries? We propose a roundtable discussion among technology scholars who intersect with several interest groups and divisions to engage these questions and the audience in conversation. Introductory questions based on the above will be presented by the chairs during the first ten minutes, followed by panelists’ five minute presentations.

Curiosity Killed the CAT?

Journalistic Cultures in the 21st Century: Lessons Learned From the First Wave of the Journalistic Role Performance Project,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Southport 1 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Research on role performance has gained great relevance within the journalistic field, examining factors that may lead to disjunction between normative standards, professional ideals and journalistic practices across different spaces and time; that is, providing a more thorough understanding of the processes of professional practice in relation to the ideals of journalistic roles in a fluid media environment. As a concept, role performance helps to focus on journalism as social practice and to shed light on the interplay between structure, agency, culture, and the political economy of the media (Voltmer, 2012; Gerrero & Márquez Ramírez, 2014; Mellado et al., 2017), putting the debate on self-perception versus practices, ideal types versus hybridization, and local versus global, at the center of scholarly attention. One of the most wide-ranging collaborative studies in this area is the Journalistic Role Performance (JRP) Project www.journalisticperformance.org, an international endeavor (2012-2020) that analyzes how different dimensions of professional roles manifest in journalistic and media practice, as well as the disconnection between ideals, self-reported behaviors, and professional performance, (e.g., Mellado 2019; Márquez et al. 2019: Humanes & Roses 2018; Mellado et al. 2017; Hallin & Mellado 2018; Stępińska et al. 2016; Wang, Sparks, & Huang 2018; Mellado & van Dalen 2017). While this project first focused on 18 countries, it has expanded to more than 40 sociopolitical and news-production environments across the world. The fieldwork of its second wave will start in 2020. From novel conceptual perspectives to fresh methodological approaches, research on role performance has contributed to and complemented the analysis of journalistic cultures and its integration to the broader field of media and communication. The research has supported the idea that professional roles are fluid, contextual and have an always-evolving collective nature, shaped through social environments, organizational structures, journalistic routines, and the local context of the news (Mellado, Hellmueller & Donsbach, 2017; Mellado, 2015). These studies have also highlighted the inevitable gap between norms, ideals and professional practices (Tandoc et al. 2013; Mellado & Van Dalen 2014), as well as the multilayered hybridization of journalistic cultures (Mellado et al., 2017; Marquez et al., 2019). After almost 10 years of studies, and prior to the beginning of the second wave of this international and collaborative project, this panel provides an opportunity to reflect across different stages and milestones of this research journey and critically discuss the lessons learned from its first wave (2013-2018), its main contributions and limitations. It considers the theoretical questions that need to be yet addressed, as well as the methodological challenges and blind spots that need to be overcome. Based on data spanning a wide range of countries gathered during the first wave of the project, as well as theoretical and methodological developments, the papers of this panel will discuss new conceptual frameworks on the relationship between attitudes and practice in journalism, theorizing the rhetoric-performance gap at the institutional level; the interplay between roles, professional identity and journalistic cultures; the concept of hybridity in journalism studies, and propose novel ways of investigating emerging journalistic roles in the context of new media logics.

Journalistic Cultures in the 21st Century: Lessons Learned From the First Wave of the Journalistic Role Performance Project,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Southport 1 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Research on role performance has gained great relevance within the journalistic field, examining factors that may lead to disjunction between normative standards, professional ideals and journalistic practices across different spaces and time; that is, providing a more thorough understanding of the processes of professional practice in relation to the ideals of journalistic roles in a fluid media environment. As a concept, role performance helps to focus on journalism as social practice and to shed light on the interplay between structure, agency, culture, and the political economy of the media (Voltmer, 2012; Gerrero & Márquez Ramírez, 2014; Mellado et al., 2017), putting the debate on self-perception versus practices, ideal types versus hybridization, and local versus global, at the center of scholarly attention. One of the most wide-ranging collaborative studies in this area is the Journalistic Role Performance (JRP) Project www.journalisticperformance.org, an international endeavor (2012-2020) that analyzes how different dimensions of professional roles manifest in journalistic and media practice, as well as the disconnection between ideals, self-reported behaviors, and professional performance, (e.g., Mellado 2019; Márquez et al. 2019: Humanes & Roses 2018; Mellado et al. 2017; Hallin & Mellado 2018; Stępińska et al. 2016; Wang, Sparks, & Huang 2018; Mellado & van Dalen 2017). While this project first focused on 18 countries, it has expanded to more than 40 sociopolitical and news-production environments across the world. The fieldwork of its second wave will start in 2020. From novel conceptual perspectives to fresh methodological approaches, research on role performance has contributed to and complemented the analysis of journalistic cultures and its integration to the broader field of media and communication. The research has supported the idea that professional roles are fluid, contextual and have an always-evolving collective nature, shaped through social environments, organizational structures, journalistic routines, and the local context of the news (Mellado, Hellmueller & Donsbach, 2017; Mellado, 2015). These studies have also highlighted the inevitable gap between norms, ideals and professional practices (Tandoc et al. 2013; Mellado & Van Dalen 2014), as well as the multilayered hybridization of journalistic cultures (Mellado et al., 2017; Marquez et al., 2019). After almost 10 years of studies, and prior to the beginning of the second wave of this international and collaborative project, this panel provides an opportunity to reflect across different stages and milestones of this research journey and critically discuss the lessons learned from its first wave (2013-2018), its main contributions and limitations. It considers the theoretical questions that need to be yet addressed, as well as the methodological challenges and blind spots that need to be overcome. Based on data spanning a wide range of countries gathered during the first wave of the project, as well as theoretical and methodological developments, the papers of this panel will discuss new conceptual frameworks on the relationship between attitudes and practice in journalism, theorizing the rhetoric-performance gap at the institutional level; the interplay between roles, professional identity and journalistic cultures; the concept of hybridity in journalism studies, and propose novel ways of investigating emerging journalistic roles in the context of new media logics.

Within these lines, the question we are posing is how can we; as scholars, teachers, and academics; bring research on racial and ethnic tensions out of journals and classrooms and into the outside world on campus and beyond. Racial and ethnic exclusiveness and othering are evident in many forms varying from microaggressions to blatant racist discourse and actions in all aspects of society, including but certainly not limited to higher education institutions. Students are exposed to othering (Dalib et al., 2017; Yung, 2016); scholars of color and/or scholars belonging to minority groups experience alienation and discrimination (Lugo-Lugo, 2012); and society beyond the college campus both reflects and contributes to continuing racial and ethnic divisions (Croucher and Kramer, 2017). Our aim is to take theoretical communication research and transform it into the practical, transform lofty ideals and turn them into every day practices, and to take what is intimidating and often indecipherable information and shape it into everyday practices that are meaningful for both the academic and everyday citizens. Thus, it is crucial for academics to take their research, expertise, and experience out of the physical classroom and help implement change for students, scholars, and the community beyond. Our panelists will explore racial and ethnic issues in and outside of academia, present strategies to address these critical exigencies, and propose new approaches that transport our research from dusty academic journals into people’s lives where it can make a significant difference. To this end, Tina M. Harris, Rockia Harris, and Jon Sahlman will analyze peer advocacy as means for combatting racial micro and macroaggressions toward Students of Color. Shardé M.

To this end, Tina M. Harris, Rockia Harris, and Jon Sahlman will analyze peer advocacy as means for combatting racial micro and macroaggressions toward Students of Color. Shardé M. Davis will explore how Black women researchers utilize collaborative autoethnographic reflections for addressing exclusion in academia. Nurhayat Bilge and Matthew Petrunia will discuss initiatives to improve cultural competence and promote more effective cross-cultural communication that reaches outside the classroom. Cerise L.

Open Communication: Taking Race and Ethnicity Theories Beyond the Classroom,Panel Session,Ethnicity and Race in Communication,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC U ROOM 9 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The call for Ethnicity and Race in Communication Division specifies: ""Open Communication, provides an opportunity to also analyse and reflect on how as scholars, teachers and activists, we can undertake research areas and processes that are truly inclusive and transparent so that people of every background and identity can relate to them and use them, without barriers, to understand and act on the world around us in meaningful ways."" Within these lines, the question we are posing is how can we; as scholars, teachers, and academics; bring research on racial and ethnic tensions out of journals and classrooms and into the outside world on campus and beyond. Racial and ethnic exclusiveness and othering are evident in many forms varying from microaggressions to blatant racist discourse and actions in all aspects of society, including but certainly not limited to higher education institutions. Students are exposed to othering (Dalib et al., 2017; Yung, 2016); scholars of color and/or scholars belonging to minority groups experience alienation and discrimination (Lugo-Lugo, 2012); and society beyond the college campus both reflects and contributes to continuing racial and ethnic divisions (Croucher and Kramer, 2017). Our aim is to take theoretical communication research and transform it into the practical, transform lofty ideals and turn them into every day practices, and to take what is intimidating and often indecipherable information and shape it into everyday practices that are meaningful for both the academic and everyday citizens. Thus, it is crucial for academics to take their research, expertise, and experience out of the physical classroom and help implement change for students, scholars, and the community beyond. Our panelists will explore racial and ethnic issues in and outside of academia, present strategies to address these critical exigencies, and propose new approaches that transport our research from dusty academic journals into people’s lives where it can make a significant difference.

Political Communication in the Context of the Antigovernment Protest in Hong Kong,Panel Session,Political Communication,23-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:A massive antigovernment movement launched in June 2019 has brought Hong Kong to the world's attention. The history of Hong Kong as a British colony for more than 150 years has left a strong impression of liberal values, while public opinion in Hong Kong is changing at a breakneck pace under the growing influence of China. Behind the rapid change is no shortage of essential topics in political communication, such as partisan media and selective exposure, the increasing influence of social media and messaging apps (e.g., Telegram), and the hybridized identity of Chinese and Hong Kong people. The panel aims to empirically articulate the communication issues behind the ongoing protest and public opinion dynamics in Hong Kong. M. S. Lin and others focus on the changes in the complex identity of the Hong Kong people since the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 and demonstrate that the Hong Kongese identity becomes salient in political and cultural issues, whereas the Chinese identity is more strongly primed in economic issues. Political polarization between pro-democracy and pro-establishment camps is another prominent feature of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. By analyzing the longitudinal public opinion polls, Wu and Shen demonstrate Hong Kong citizens’ opinions has polarized in political, economic or livelihood domains. W. Y. Lin focuses on the vocal expression of political opinions during the protest from the viewpoint of the spiral of silence. The perceived climate of opinion is analyzed through in-depth interviews with young Hong Kong citizens which provides thick descriptions of their political engagement in relation to their media connections during the protest. M. J. Lin and Tung present the field experiment conducted in the context of Hong Kong’s July 1st Democracy Rally in 2019. By randomly assigning Taiwanese and Hong Kongese interviewers in the field, they a significant difference between the two groups in terms of respondents’ self-censoring behavior, i.e., protesters’ propensities to reveal or conceal who they are.

This panel, which celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Australian and New Zealand Communication Association as a site for exchanging communication scholarship, is concerned with identifying principles and practices that might sustain and enrich communication scholars' communication at the critical interface between the academy and society. Specifically, it asks what can we learn by examining other enduring social interfaces, both past and present, across which knowledge has been effectively exchanged? What principles and practices embedded in these interfaces ensure that the knowledge exchanged continues to be valued and relevant in the face of unprecedented knowledge accessibility and transit? How can researchers apply these principles and practices in the name of open science yet also protect the integrity and longevity of the academy-societal interface?

To address these questons Gerard Goggin (Singapore), the first of our three speakers explores the interface between digital humanities and open communication research policies by examining the success of two recent policy moments in Australia.

"Adolescent Social Media Use and Well-Being: Considering Individual Differences, Differential Use, and Cross-Platform Comparisons",Panel Session,"Children, Adolescents and Media",23-May-2020,12:30 PM,1:45 PM,CC U ROOM 7 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Researchers have generated a large literature examining adolescents’ social media use and well-being, including self-esteem (Woods & Scott, 2016) and body satisfaction (Kleemans et al., 2018) for example. This work has largely considered Facebook, as it was initially the most popular social media platform among adolescents. Use patterns have changed markedly, however. For example, in 2010, Lenhart and colleagues found that Facebook was the most used platform by adolescents in the United States. Just 8% of surveyed adolescents reported using Twitter, and Instagram and Snapchat did not yet exist. Recently, however, adolescents reported that Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter use are all popular (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Thus, there have been major changes in the popularity and availability of social media platforms in the past decade. Thus, it is not clear if the links between Facebook use and adolescent well-being generalize to this contemporary social media landscape. Indeed, in order to build a literature that is agile to the waxing and waning of social media platform popularity, it is important to design research with an eye toward ensuring that findings remain meaningful over time. Researchers have begun to address these questions of generalizability in two ways. First, researchers have conceptualized social media use as being either active, involving the creation and posting of content, or passive, involving viewing of others’ content. Second, researchers have examined cross-platform differences, categorizing platforms based on the type of features available. To that end, this panel brings together researchers from four universities, representing three countries, employing four distinct methodologies, to understand differnetial use patterns of social media, as well as platfrom differences, as they relate to user well-being. Presentation #1 uses qualitative focus group data to demonstrate how adolescents hold very different conceptualizations about four social media platforns. Presentations #2 and #4 consider different types of social media interactions on different platforms to explore differential linkes between social media content, life satisfaction, and alcohol use. Presentation #3 uses digital trace data to examine how different characteristics of users influence social media use, as well as the nature of that use. Finally, presentation #5 reports on a multi-method study, demonstrating how different types of use, both within and across platforms, relates to adolescents’ subjective well-being. Together, all studies offer implications for theory pertaining to adolescent social media use and well-being, and offer different methodologies that can be used to measure adolescents’ social media use. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:N/A","Chairs: Drew Cingel, U of California, Davis;Discussant: Ellen Wartella, Northwestern U",Adolescent Conceptualizations of Different Social Media Platforms,12:30 PM,12:30 PM,D.

"BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: How to Situate Yourself in Academic Gaming Research: The Journals and Conferences, and How They Work",Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,23-May-2020,12:30 PM,1:45 PM,Star X Currumbin Room (Star Pool Level),"400-word Panel Rationale:The goal of this session is to lay out an overview of game studies as it is embodied by the many conferences and journals where its research is found, and to discuss where it might be headed in order to help scholars situate themselves and their work within it. Part of the impetus for this proposal is a conversation we started at the Game Studies business meeting at ICA 2019 in Washington, D.C., where many of us with highly diverse yet all game-centric backgrounds were present. There was significant interest in this topic but we did not have enough time to address all of the issues. Within game studies, a growing and multi-disciplinary field, there is a large amount of scholarship in a number of venues (conferences and journals). It is impossible for most people to be acquainted with many of these venues given time and funding constraints. This problem is especially challenging for junior scholars and this Blue Sky session will be particularly helpful to them as they seek to develop their place within the field. Our panelists for the session bring a wide variety of game-scholarship experience, including conference and journal leadership roles, and will contextualize their perspectives within the contours of the field, with additions and questions from the audience. By doing so, we hope to help scholars understand the parts of the field that they are not familiar with and probably don't have the time and resources to explore fully on their own. Many conferences and journals differ significantly from ICA in terms of costs, proceedings as publication, culture, and audience, and knowing how to navigate this world is important for situating one's work. The discussion will start with each panelist discussing the game-related conferences, journals, and other outlets with which they are most familiar, the topics, methods and formats those venues favor, and any logistical differences of note (e.g., conference size, fees, and implications for publication). Using these short introductions as a starting point, audience members will then be asked to do the same so as to build a holistic picture of the field. Through this discussion, we hope to develop a broad overview of the field in terms of how the different pieces fit together, with both input from the panelists and audience. Audience participation is important, adding perspectives and details about different venues beyond panelists' knowledge.|Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Discussant: Nicholas Bowman, Texas Tech U;Discussant: Vivian Hsueh Hua Chen, Nanyang Technological U;Discussant: Mia Consalvo, Concordia U;Chairs: Nathaniel Poor, Underwood Institute;Discussant: Rabindra (Robby) Ratan, Michigan State U","How to Situate Yourself in Academic Gaming Research: The Journals and Conferences, and How They Work",12:30 PM,12:30 PM,N.

"Beyond ‘Fake News’: Evidence-Based Approaches to the Study of Mis-, Dis-, and Malinformation",Panel Session,Communication and Technology,23-May-2020,12:30 PM,1:45 PM,Star Southport 3 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The diverse and divergent phenomena now described by the colloquial term ‘fake news’ have created considerable concerns across many established and emerging democracies. Yet ‘fake news’ remains ill-defined, and incorporates a number of related but distinct phenomena that may variously be described as mis-, dis-, or malinformation (Wardle & Derakhshan 2017: 5). To date, there is only limited systematic empirical research into these phenomena, the actors driving them, and their effects on public communication and debate, and few studies address distinct national and local contexts beyond the US and UK, or develop comparative perspectives across such contexts. This panel brings together a number of critical and methodologically innovative studies that extend and enrich the existing evidence base that traces the dissemination and impact of “problematic information” (Jack 2017). Paper 1 presents results from a major study of online disinformation dissemination across six countries in Europe and North America, highlighting both the ways in which such information spreads and the resilience of online communities against its deleterious effects. Paper 2 draws on evidence on the use of computational propaganda in 20 elections around the world to assess how such digital manipulation affects citizens’ ability to participate in key political processes. Paper 3 draws on major datasets that capture the sharing of links to dozens of established mainstream as well as suspected malinformation sources on Twitter to compare the respective dissemination careers of content from these sources, showing clear divergences in sharing patterns that can be traced to the activities of human and automated actors. Paper 4 examines the role of mainstream news organisations in the dissemination of patriotic and politically motivated ‘fake news’ narratives, against the backdrop of the current and continuing conflict over Catalan independence from Spain. In combination, these contributions to the study of problematic information help move this field of research beyond reductive and underdetermined terms such as ‘fake news’. They investigate various facets of mis-, dis-, and malinformation, place these in the context of national mediaspheres and local political conflicts, and in doing so generate important new evidence for the impacts of such information on legitimate public communication and political debate.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Axel Bruns, Queensland U of Technology",Resilience to Online Disinformation: A Six-Country Comparison,12:30 PM,12:30 PM,E.

China is already the world’s largest user of the internet, followed by India. Apart from being the world’s two most populous countries and fastest-growing large economies, both China and India are also civilizational powers, with old and distinctive cultures and aspirations for a greater role in a multipolar world. The international presence of Chinese and Indian voices is likely to expand with the growing convergence of mobile communications technologies and content via an altered and multi-lingual internet – helped by the world’s two largest diasporas. This transformation of the global media and communication landscape challenges the analytical frameworks of traditional Western originated and oriented communication theory – whether liberal or critical. Despite the growing globalization of faculty and students and the establishment of international hubs of higher education, the study of communication remains embedded in a Western discourse. American communication and media schools, especially, have produced the majority of textbook and journal publishing in the area. Consequently, US-approaches have been adopted in communication courses around the world, particularly in the global South. The continued dominance of a Western-centric epistemology for the study of communication could hinder a more nuanced analysis of the phenomena of transnational communication. Many scholars in the global South have suggested new approaches to going beyond the Western-originated paradigms, arguing for ‘decolonization’ of communication studies. There is need to reinvigorate the rapidly growing and globalizing field of communication, extending its remit and entering an interdisciplinary dialogue with non-Western approaches, as well as with other social sciences. The panellists - leading scholars of international communication - will evaluate how the unprecedented expansion of media and communication in the global South is changing the communication landscape. As these media globalize further, will they develop an alternative narrative and provide spaces for the hitherto marginal voices in global communication sphere? While recognizing the constraints of a global communication system that continues to be controlled by the West, the panellists will suggest that internationalization should ideally be an integral part of teaching and research in communication, given the global nature of the subject and the globalization of the media and communication industries. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:Not applicable","Chairs: Daya Thussu, Hong Kong Baptist U;Discussant: Herman Wasserman, U of Cape Town",Historicising Global Communication,12:30 PM,12:30 PM,D.

Critical Perspectives on Open Science,Panel Session,Theme,23-May-2020,12:30 PM,1:45 PM,CC U ROOM 9 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel brings together interpretive scholars from various divisions of ICA to explore and critique various questions related to open science. Interpretive or qualitative communication researchers have long had to contend with important questions regarding the credibility, transferability, and truthfulness of our research because valuations of validity, reliability and generalizability are not necessarily relevant factors in interpretive research. As such, we have had to develop our own standards and best practices for generating trustworthy and significant research. There are several limitations to common open science initiatives for qualitative interpretive social sciences. For example, preregistration is a very important initiative for open science where the distinctions between predictions and postdictions are central to the scientific and statistical assumptions of experimental and quasi-experimental research (Nosek, Ebersole, DeHaven, & Mellor, 2018). However, for more inductive or abductive research designs, there is and should be significant blurring between prediction and postdictions. Indeed, it is the iterative process of data collection and analysis that strengthens the research process and our trust in the subsequent findings (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Another common open science initiative is that of data sharing, where researchers make their anonymized data publicly available to reviewers and other researchers. However, important questions emerge for interpretive or community-based research initiatives regarding the contextual integrity of the data. For example, the positionality of the researcher and their relationship with the community of study may often be so central to the research that to anonymize it to make public renders it meaningless or open to mis-interpretation (Mauthner & Parry, 2009). The open communication and science initiatives need more critical dialogue about what “open” really means and for whom it is meant. For example, community-based and participatory action research initiatives change the relationship between the researcher and the participants to one of collaboration, rather than data extraction. Any data sharing initiatives must consider, therefore, not just the researcher or the granting organization’s preferences for data sharing, but the participant collaborators as well and the protection of their privacy. The panelists here draw on a variety of epistemological approaches through which to examine and broaden discussions of knowledge production within communication studies. Open science initiatives would do well to engage with interpretive scholarship and methodologies or else their frameworks may be too myopic for significant scientific change. References: Glaser, B.

Yet in recent decades we have witnessed fandom become increasingly mainstream, with scholars like Matt Hills and Louisa Stein pointing to the rise of popular geek culture and movement of fandom from niche collectives to commodified target markets. At the same time, fan studies has been criticized for its tendency to center the experiences of white, female, able-bodied, middle-class fans, with Rebecca Wanzo specifically calling attention to the centrality of whiteness of fandom and fan studies. This means that within a field of study that has historically excluded traditionally marginalized communities such as people of color and people with disabilities, we are now seeing even more potential to reify hegemonic power dynamics. This panel participates in the project of interrogating emerging trends and working to strategically expand fan studies into new areas by centering the contributions of what we might consider “marginalized fandoms.” In line with Rukmini Pande’s call to decolonize fan studies by closely examining points of rupture and disjuncture within media fandoms, we seek to develop new modes of analysis and frameworks for making sense of marginalization in relation to race, ability, age, and sexuality. This includes scholarship by Lori Kido Lopez on the Asian American fans and audiences who have historically been absent and invisible even within scholarship on fans of color, and a paper by Divya Garg on the connection between queer sexuality and disabled subjectivities in her analysis of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Another aspect of marginalization is the kinds of fans and audiences who are unfairly stigmatized or feared, as Jessica Balanzategui assesses in her study of anxieties surrounding the power of child audiences in shaping YouTube content. Our last two papers examine the role of queerness within the hegemonic fandoms of sports and superhero television. Samantha Close studies the global queer fans of esports and the challenging territory they must navigate in relation to its blend of toxic masculinity and queer possibility, and Rukmini Pande investigates the difference between fan responses to Black lesbian characters and white queer characters in superhero narratives.|Co-Sponsorship:Ethnicity and Race in Communication|Additional Information:","Participant: Jessica Balanzategui;Participant: Samantha Close;Participant: Divya Garg;Chairs: Lori Lopez, U of Wisconsin-Madison;Participant: Rukmini Pande, OP Jindal Global U",Fandom and Disability: Marvel Fans’ Dis/Abling Experiences in Global Media Fandom,12:30 PM,12:30 PM,D.

"Marginalized Fandoms: Widening the Lens on Race, Ability, and Age in Fan Cultures",Panel Session,Popular Communication,23-May-2020,12:30 PM,1:45 PM,CC G ARENA 1A (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Fan studies scholarship has traditionally focused on the subcultural formations of like-minded networks in which individuals connect and share about beloved texts, with feminist scholars leading the way in celebrating the resistant potential of fan practices. Yet in recent decades we have witnessed fandom become increasingly mainstream, with scholars like Matt Hills and Louisa Stein pointing to the rise of popular geek culture and movement of fandom from niche collectives to commodified target markets. At the same time, fan studies has been criticized for its tendency to center the experiences of white, female, able-bodied, middle-class fans, with Rebecca Wanzo specifically calling attention to the centrality of whiteness of fandom and fan studies. This means that within a field of study that has historically excluded traditionally marginalized communities such as people of color and people with disabilities, we are now seeing even more potential to reify hegemonic power dynamics. This panel participates in the project of interrogating emerging trends and working to strategically expand fan studies into new areas by centering the contributions of what we might consider “marginalized fandoms.” In line with Rukmini Pande’s call to decolonize fan studies by closely examining points of rupture and disjuncture within media fandoms, we seek to develop new modes of analysis and frameworks for making sense of marginalization in relation to race, ability, age, and sexuality. This includes scholarship by Lori Kido Lopez on the Asian American fans and audiences who have historically been absent and invisible even within scholarship on fans of color, and a paper by Divya Garg on the connection between queer sexuality and disabled subjectivities in her analysis of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Another aspect of marginalization is the kinds of fans and audiences who are unfairly stigmatized or feared, as Jessica Balanzategui assesses in her study of anxieties surrounding the power of child audiences in shaping YouTube content. Our last two papers examine the role of queerness within the hegemonic fandoms of sports and superhero television.

At the same time, modes of videogame production beyond the traditional ‘game industry’ are increasingly visible, imagining countercultural modes of game production that work against more typical expectations of the development process. In their articulations of labour and creative work, the shared software and platforms of development and distribution, and their overlapping audiences, the cultures and countercultures of contemporary game development intersect at a number of tensions that are crucial for the emerging subdiscipline of ‘game production studies,’ an which form the basis of this panel. These studies bring together an international group of game scholars to probe this relationship between videogame production cultures and countercultures. Our interest in a ‘cultural vs. countercultural’ view of game production and related understandings—including but not limited to legitimate vs. alternative, formal vs. informal, mainstream vs. emergent production—is in acknowledging the increasing difficulty in distinguishing these prominent modes of game development and in teasing apart how these production cultures interact with each other. The various tools, studios, and people we examine both acquiesce to certain expectations of game development and engage in imagining game development in ways that transcend the precarious, stressful, or contentious environments of production. Brendan Keogh and Benjamin Nicoll begin by considering the ambivalences surrounding the alleged ‘democratisation’ of game development tools such as Unity and Twine. Drawing from empirical research, they analyse how developers themselves articulate and negotiate the politics of democratisation. Amanda Cote and Brandon Harris then use a critical discourse analysis of the trade magazine Game Developer (2000-2010) to contend that “crunch” as a labor practice has been built into the habitus of game development and argue for an intervention into this cultural reproduction. Rae Moors continues with an analysis of indie dev blogs, understanding them both as a way to circulate game information and a way for developers to exert a sense of control over the often precarious development process. Mahli-Ann Butt concludes the panel with observations from ethnographic data of how game developers cope with crunch, precarity, and burnout. Taken together, this panel offers various insights into game production cultures and countercultures, and asks what it means for researchers when the assumed logics or expectations that underlie production cultures are turned on their head and require reimagining. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Mahli-Ann Butt, University of Sydney;Participant: Amanda Cote, U of Oregon;Participant: Brandon Harris, U of Oregon;Participant: Brendan Keogh, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Rae Moors, U of Michigan;Chairs: Rae Moors, U of Michigan;Participant: Benjamin Nicoll, Queensland U of Technology",Game Engines and the Politics of Democratised Development,12:30 PM,12:30 PM,B.

At the same time, modes of videogame production beyond the traditional ‘game industry’ are increasingly visible, imagining countercultural modes of game production that work against more typical expectations of the development process. In their articulations of labour and creative work, the shared software and platforms of development and distribution, and their overlapping audiences, the cultures and countercultures of contemporary game development intersect at a number of tensions that are crucial for the emerging subdiscipline of ‘game production studies,’ an which form the basis of this panel. These studies bring together an international group of game scholars to probe this relationship between videogame production cultures and countercultures. Our interest in a ‘cultural vs. countercultural’ view of game production and related understandings—including but not limited to legitimate vs. alternative, formal vs. informal, mainstream vs. emergent production—is in acknowledging the increasing difficulty in distinguishing these prominent modes of game development and in teasing apart how these production cultures interact with each other. The various tools, studios, and people we examine both acquiesce to certain expectations of game development and engage in imagining game development in ways that transcend the precarious, stressful, or contentious environments of production. Brendan Keogh and Benjamin Nicoll begin by considering the ambivalences surrounding the alleged ‘democratisation’ of game development tools such as Unity and Twine. Drawing from empirical research, they analyse how developers themselves articulate and negotiate the politics of democratisation. Amanda Cote and Brandon Harris then use a critical discourse analysis of the trade magazine Game Developer (2000-2010) to contend that “crunch” as a labor practice has been built into the habitus of game development and argue for an intervention into this cultural reproduction. Rae Moors continues with an analysis of indie dev blogs, understanding them both as a way to circulate game information and a way for developers to exert a sense of control over the often precarious development process.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: How the World Sees the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election in the Age of Trump,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,23-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC G HALL 4 - MULLET (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:President Trump’s foreign policy has been rhetorically bombastic in its tweets and pronouncements of fighting terrorists abroad while strengthening security at home. In tandem with his America First approach to trade relations and his diplomatic mission to convert old enemies into friends this U.S. president promised not to inflict American culture on the world and instead let the U.S. way of life “shine for everyone to follow.” Clearly some world leaders pursued his style instead of substance. In view of President Trump’s aggressive communications in the United States and his polarizing acts on the world stage, in tandem with trends toward populism, it is a compelling time for academic voices at ICA to share their applications of the relevant theories to explain this communication phenomenon and offer insights to understand his unique political discourse. Consider, for example, such theories as media governance, social identity or the concepts of tribalism with particular regard to this election season affording a microcosm for ICA to analyze the processes and effects of the U.S. presidential election in the practical context of theory building. This workshop will invite scholars who can present research proposing a particular theory and application to give a multiplicity of perspectives on this particular U.S. presidency and his campaign terrain. Because U.S. elections have such global consequences we invite the application of communication theories that are both robust and well situated for scholars to a particular framework that explains and predicts how this election might have consequential impact. For example, concepts of social identity combined with the tools of framing and agenda setting would be one theoretical intersection where a well-defined exploration of the varied perspectives and epistemological viewpoints could be formed. This forum should give rise to a lively discussion to engage the most pertinent possibilities and construct a theoretical bridge between key political communication concepts. From such conceptualizations an analysis of the Trump administration’s grasp of power in the midst of a presidential race gives rise to excitement of theory building. This workshop aims to explore, redefine, and delimit the concept and theories of political communication to achieve a means for communication policy research. And though this workshop addresses issues set in a political context, it should be of interest to scholars spanning the fields of international communication and public diplomacy, journalism, public relations, computer mediated communication, social activism and social justice, among others. |Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:Journalism Studies,Mobile Communication,Political Communication|Additional Information:","Moderator: William Davie, U of Louisiana at Lafayette;Moderator: Jeff Wilkinson, Florida A&M U;Participant: Phillip Arceneaux, Center for Media & Public Opinion",,,,,,,

This panel brings together five talks in which panelists are unusually open about their methods to allow for conversations that make replication possible. Digital media offer the potential for quicker data processing, for helping find patterns that are less obvious to the naked eye, for access to information about people’s everyday behavior, for unearthing connections that require large processing power, and the list goes on. Nonetheless, traditional methodological considerations such as sampling bias remain important aspects of research given that more data do not necessarily mean better data. More is sometimes more of the same bad information and can result in mistaken conclusions and may hinder the reproducibility of findings if the large data sets represent sampling biases. The mere existence of more data is also not helpful if much of this is not visible to researchers, and social interactions heretofore accessible to the in-person observer are now restricted to people’s screens to which researchers conducting face-to-face interviews and observations may not be privy. Indeed, opportunities often come hand-in-hand with challenges from data quality to data access, including ethical considerations. This panel brings together scholars doing cutting-edge research both using digital media to study social science questions as well as asking social science questions about digital media’s increasing importance in everyday life. Panelists will explicitly reflect on the behind-the-scenes realities of their experiences, sharing details that are rarely included in the methods sections of papers even though they are essential for understanding how research actually gets done. Panelists come from four continents and represent a wide range of methods, some completely novel, others the application of more traditional approaches in the digital context.

Indeed, opportunities often come hand-in-hand with challenges from data quality to data access, including ethical considerations. This panel brings together scholars doing cutting-edge research both using digital media to study social science questions as well as asking social science questions about digital media’s increasing importance in everyday life. Panelists will explicitly reflect on the behind-the-scenes realities of their experiences, sharing details that are rarely included in the methods sections of papers even though they are essential for understanding how research actually gets done. Panelists come from four continents and represent a wide range of methods, some completely novel, others the application of more traditional approaches in the digital context. Keller reports on the cat-and-mouse game of detecting automated Twitter accounts using computational methods, Humphreys emphasizes the importance of applying careful research design and sampling to qualitative studies, Marler shares insights from his experiences studying the digital media uses of homeless people, Seo describes her intervention study to support low-income older African Americans in their computer and Internet uses, and Correa exposes the challenges of using both interviews and surveys to study rural villagers in Chile. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Teresa Correa, Diego Portales U;Moderator: Eszter Hargittai, U of Zürich;Participant: Lee Humphreys, Cornell U;Participant: Tobias Keller, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Will Marler, Northwestern U;Participant: Hyunjin Seo, U of Kansas",Community-Based Intervention Research Strategies: Digital Inclusion for Marginalized Populations,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,H.

As described by Janey Gordon (2012), community radio carries with it the potential to promote social capital, social worth and ultimately social gain to both geographic communities and communities of interest. It is considered to be an important cultural resource (Forde et al 2002) with the potential to realise goals of both horizontal and participatory communication (Srinivasan & Ramos-Martín). The scholarship of community radio is as diverse as its object of study. This panel interrogates community radio activity in a variety of countries through a multiplicity of lenses. What is the value of established community radio in Australia, when social media platforms enable a proliferation of voice? How does the role of the individual as an everyday activist within community radio in South India create change? What can we learn from considering liminality and space in the policy advocacy for community radio in Sri Lanka and Nepal? Can prisoners’ radio push back against dominant punitive discourses in Canada? Each paper presents a unique perspective on community radio while showcasing its collective value. We aim to demonstrate the richness of community radio studies and to pose questions and plant seeds for further research in this area.

The Tragedy of the Discursive Commons: Considering ‘Closed’ Environmental Communication and Opportunities for ‘Opening',Panel Session,Environmental Communication,23-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC U ROOM 7 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:While enclosure of the ecological commons is a familiar heuristic [1], this panel considers the discursive commons as similarly vulnerable to processes of enclosure and over-extraction. The public’s collective capacity to attend to environmental issues is a finite resource that, in Gareth Hardin’s famous essay, was just as susceptible to “muddying” and the “pollution of advertising” as the ecological commons [2]. Engaging the public, therefore, is a competitive, consequential and lucrative pursuit; yet one that arguably yields declining returns. In the race for visibility and engagement in the ‘attention economy’, and across decentralized social networks and movements, sprawling environmental discourses are necessarily simplified, enclosed and monetized. Cascading environmental harms are condensed into flagship single-issue campaigns; Indigenous knowledge is bypassed in colonial and Cartesian otherings of the environment; the technocratic state prescribes acceptable problems and solutions; global environmental certification standards clash with the expectations of non-government actors; and the environment is aestheticized and gentrified as a lure for the transnational creative class at the expense of local experiences and hopes. These delimitations are also relatively opaque. They make it harder to see and reason with the complexity of ecological change and to engage with prospective solutions on all but the most superficial level. Acceptable ways of perceiving the environment become imbricated with group identities, driving polarization and reducing opportunities for constructive dialogue; ambitious environmental policy is construed as frivolous utopianism; tentative experts become political operatives while the fatigued public loses interest. This is the tragedy of the discursive commons and it is unclear whether more information, transparency and data, alone, are adequate solutions. This panel brings together researchers embedded in the complexity of environmental change and mediated environmental conflict to discuss how a functioning discursive commons might be maintained. With reference to case studies from three continents, the panel responds to Pierre Bourdieu’s recommendation that “[knowledge] producers in their little citadels have to learn how to get out and fight collectively for optimum conditions of diffusion and for ownership of the relevant means of diffusion” [3].

The public’s collective capacity to attend to environmental issues is a finite resource that, in Gareth Hardin’s famous essay, was just as susceptible to “muddying” and the “pollution of advertising” as the ecological commons [2]. Engaging the public, therefore, is a competitive, consequential and lucrative pursuit; yet one that arguably yields declining returns. In the race for visibility and engagement in the ‘attention economy’, and across decentralized social networks and movements, sprawling environmental discourses are necessarily simplified, enclosed and monetized. Cascading environmental harms are condensed into flagship single-issue campaigns; Indigenous knowledge is bypassed in colonial and Cartesian otherings of the environment; the technocratic state prescribes acceptable problems and solutions; global environmental certification standards clash with the expectations of non-government actors; and the environment is aestheticized and gentrified as a lure for the transnational creative class at the expense of local experiences and hopes.

We strongly support ethical behavior, but we are also mindful of the mismatch between the stated concern and the proposed response. There is no particular mystery to the dynamics of this response in the current moment, given the challenges posed by the very forms of polarization and partisanship that are identified as part of the problem of online political discourse. A solution that is portrayed as overtly political immediately raises partisan hackles, whereas everyone can agree that ethical behavior is important. At the same time, we recognize the long-standing history of “ethics policies” and ethical guidelines in providing a more palatable alternative to regulation for commercial entities. The goal of this panel is to diagnose the political challenges posed by platform media and to consider what it might mean to consider a civic and political response to the political pathologies attributed to the widespread impact of platform media on the circulation of news and information. The panel brings together a diverse group of scholars from two continents to build on work they have done on the political and social implications of platform media. Sarah Roberts draws on her long-term ethnographic study of content moderators to provide insight into the priorities that shape the online information environment. Her contribution raises the question of what it might mean to incorporate civic consideration into platform policies. It also highlights some of the tensions between stated ethical commitments and the guidelines given to (and treatment of) the largely invisible (to users) workforce of content moderators.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Opening New Connections: Community-Engaged Scholarship With Students and Faculty,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"400-word Panel Rationale:Participants in this Blue Sky Workshop will learn about designing and implementing research projects that fall under the umbrella of community-engaged scholarship (CES). The workshop will begin by allowing participants to brainstorm ideas and offer examples of past projects that have served community partners’ needs for original research. Once participants learn about the history of CES and brainstorm ideas that would work for these types of projects, the workshop will offer a guided process of developing ideas into project plans that can be presented to local community partner organizations (e.g., non-profit organizations, local and/or municipal governments). The workshop also will engage participants in reflection of project ideas, which will give them the opportunity to offer constructive feedback (and receive constructive criticism from chairs) on individual ideas for CES projects. The chairs also will offer any interested participant a sample syllabus and schedule for creating a class (e.g., a special topic or independent study) into which students can enroll to earn credit for participating in the research project. Interested individuals should submit a brief statement of interest and at least one idea for working with a community partner in their locale on a cooperative research projects. Plans should involve faculty and student researchers and identify what responsibilities members of the research team would have. Participants also should identify potential community partner organizations that might be interested in engaging in (or sponsoring) the proposed research project. Project proposals may be based on any methodology (qualitative, quantitative, critical, etc.). Participants are requested to bring a computer or tablet with them to the workshop. |Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Colleen Packer, Weber State U;Chairs: Robin Haislett, Weber State U;Chairs: Alexander Lancaster, Weber State U",,,,,,,

In years past, field embraced social media because we realized the value of open and digital communication it offered both in practice and pedagogy. As communication technology evolves, our field should also embrace the future of social and open communication with virtual reality (VR) and what it can offer our pedagogical experiences. This workshop will cover four key and applicable areas of of introducing social VR into the communication classroom. The first area of focus will be an overview of social VR and a history of VR as it relates to its uses in the communication field. The second area of focus will consist of in-depth examples and discussions of the advantages and challenges of bringing social VR into the communication classroom. The third area of focus will provide attendees the opportunity to interact with VR by using state-of-the-art VR headsets. This way, attendees can actually experience social VR and gain better insights on how it can be used to build out and advance their specific curriculum. Lastly, the fourth focus area for this workshop will include and overview of resources and funding opportunities to help bring social VR to workshop attendees’ campuses to further the progression of social VR use in our field of communication. |Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:N/A","Chairs: Candace Parrish, Sacred Heart U;Chairs: Shanshan Wang, Sacred Heart University",,,,,,,

Blue Sky Professional Development Workshop: The Magic of Unguided Longhand Freewriting,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,Star Stradbroke Room - Session (Star Pool Level),"400-word Panel Rationale:Do you ever experience difficulty concentrating, or being fully present, productive or motivated? Do you experience writer’s block? If so, you are not alone, especially in today’s fast-paced digital world. My goal in the workshop will be sharing with participants a technic that I call “Longhand Unguided Freewriting” (LUF) as a solution to these problems. I discovered the technic in the early 1990s after reading a book titled The Artist’s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity (Cameron, 1992/2002). At the time, I was experiencing writer’s block continuously as I tried writing my doctoral dissertation and desperately needed to overcome the problem. I felt LUF’s positive impact soon after I had started practicing it, so I continued practicing it religiously for nearly twenty years. I find LUF to be a highly effective way to become more present, focused and productive, as well as overcome writer’s block. Curious as to whether and how the technic might help decrease student apathy/indifference in classroom environment, in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017 semesters I implemented in-class LUF in the three Public Speaking courses that I was teaching at the time. My curiosity led to a qualitative research study, the findings of which indicated that in-class LUF helped “reduce their [the students’] apathy through improved self-reflexivity, decreased anxiety, and improved presence” (Keshishian, 2018, p. 68). I use LUF in all my classes. My planned schedule for the workshop is to: 1. Invite workshop attendees to participate in a 10-minute LUF; 2. Define LUF and explain its difference from guided freewriting and journaling; 3. Describe how I discovered the technique and why I consider it magical; 4. Share the findings of the qualitative study I conducted in my Public Speaking classes; 5. Share the ways in which professors, or anyone, could use LUF to benefit themselves; and 6. Inform the audience how professors could use LUF to benefit students. **** The workshop should take approximately 60 minutes. **** Requirements for interested participants: Workshop participants are asked to bring with them pens and a blank sheet of paper, or a notebook, to participate in a 10-minute longhand unguided freewriting.|Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Flora Keshishian, St. John's U",,,,,,,

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Radically Transparent Research,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Stradbroke Room - Session (Star Pool Level),"400-word Panel Rationale:Through work examining the interactions among independent game developers, the pattern of openness and collaboration is one constant within that independent industry. Many independent game developers collaborate with each other and even use game festivals or social media to connect with other developers who can help them with a problem of the design or mechanics of their current project. 

One developer livestreamed their work on an upcoming game for two reasons: first, to gain live feedback and help from the online community interested in the game, and, second, to protect themselves from the possibility of having their game idea stolen. The livestreams featured the source code, live music and art creation, the thoughts about the game from the developers as well as offering the opportunity for the community to get to know the developers. The game was a critical success.

Comparing this radical transparency to that of the extreme exclusivity mindset of the corporate game development industry (i.e. Electronic Arts, 2k Games, Ubisoft), it could be argued this closed community is stagnating and suffering from the same iteration of a product with only slight changes; sequilitis. There is no access to the inner workings of these studios and anyone with access is presented with a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

The flow of new ideas is fostered more productively in the independent game developer community as opposed to the corporate. Should academia look to this model to create more opportunities for research and generation of questions? Also, what would an active and open exchange of ideas, processes, and missteps look like in academia?

The workshop will feature a 10-minute context-setting chat from the session chairs to give all participants the common ground to discuss radical transparency in scholarly work.

--What would a radically transparent workflow look like for an academic?
--How much are/should we be willing to share?
--What obstacles would we face?
--How do we get our other colleagues to adopt the practice?
--What can we do to promote long-term use and expansion of this practice?
--How can this harm the discipline?
--What channels do we have for creating this open community of research and pedagogy?
--How can we prevent silos from forming?
--What types of and topics in research can benefit most from this practice?
--What personal fears could come from being radically transparent?

These are just a few of the platforms that have ""died"" over the past two decades, but what is ""platform death"" and what types of legal, technological, and societal pressures kill platforms? Following Carolyn Marvin (1988), we encourage the study of platforms through the lens of not just the instrument itself but also the ‘existing groups [that are] perpetually negotiating power, authority, representation, and knowledge with whatever resources available’ (p. 5). In this vein, one panelist draws on Cold War imaginaries to consider the catastrophic social disruption that can be visited upon nations through the depression of buttons designed to deny access to the internet or internet services for political purposes. Another offers a comparative analysis of journalistic coverage of platform death, focusing on the fall of two video-sharing websites, TroopTube and Vine. Two panelists tie web history and the process of archiving the ‘live web’ to the journalism industry. Another panelist considers the history of knowledge platforms or what Edwards (2010) has called “networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that generate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural worlds” (Edwards, 2010). Taken as a collective, these papers ask not only what is ‘the web that was’ but also consider what the web might become. Our aim is not to pinpoint a single formula that predicts or justifies platform death but rather through archival research, digital ethnography, and semi-structured interviews, to trace, document, and topologize the memory narratives and the power struggles surrounding divergent internet histories. We pose and strive to answer the following questions: What are dead and dying platforms? What are their futures, their pasts? What forces and factors kill a platform, and what actors and architectures help bring a platform back to life? What might a political economy of dead and dying platforms look like? What narratives and counter-narratives of dead platforms have surfaced, and what distinct methodologies can help scholars in communication studies tease out the commonalities between them? Where does data on dead platforms go? What do comparative analyses of journalistic coverage of platform death offer? How do users mourn the passage of a platform?

The truth, of course, sits somewhere in the midst of these, and is dependent on a wide range of factors, including who is campaigning, the strategies and platforms utilised, and the capacity of the cause to cut into public and political discourse. Feminist activism has been particularly effective at gaining public attention through online campaigning, and scholarly research has documented and analysed a number of these projects, often centring around hashtags such as #metoo (Mendes et al), #sayhername (Lindsey), and #BlackLivesMatter (Freelon et al.). These high profile campaigns have all also drawn both online and legacy media attention to issues of sexual assault, sex and gender discrimination, and domestic and state violence. The five papers in this panel work to extend the context in which women’s activism is considered. Drawing together scholars of Indigenous leadership, online persona, digital feminism, and social inclusion, we look to examine the role of digital media as a space for women’s activism. We examine relationships between anger, humour, and community, between making space for individual voices and producing substantive systemic change. We contest boundaries between online and offline, while acknowledging the advantages and disadvantages of mediated activism for those for whom physical protest is not viable, or safe. We explore the affordances and constraints of digital media through the context of our own research (and in some cases, our own activist practice). In doing so, we take an explicitly intersectional approach, acknowledging that the capacity to speak and be heard in online spaces is, as in other spheres of public and private life, impacted by layers of marginalisation and discrimination that fall heavily on women of colour, refugee and migrant women, working-class women, disabled women, queer, trans* and non-binary folk, among others.

We explore the affordances and constraints of digital media through the context of our own research (and in some cases, our own activist practice). In doing so, we take an explicitly intersectional approach, acknowledging that the capacity to speak and be heard in online spaces is, as in other spheres of public and private life, impacted by layers of marginalisation and discrimination that fall heavily on women of colour, refugee and migrant women, working-class women, disabled women, queer, trans* and non-binary folk, among others.

The Teresa Award for the Advancement of Feminist Scholarship recognizes work that has made significant contributions to the development, reach and influence of feminist scholarship. It awards scholars whose research has consisted of multiple projects and publications that have made a clear, coherent and sustained contribution to the advancement of feminist scholarship over time or single works and/or activities which have been highly influential in the field of feminist communication scholarship. This panel will provide a discussion among the Teresa Award Winners that highlights their contributions to feminist communication scholarship through theory and/or method. The panelists will reflect on their subfield/specialty, how it has evolved, and where it needs to turn next; address how feminisms and feminist thinking have affected their research, writing and/or subfield/specialty; and discuss how their own path in feminist scholarship has developed. The Teresa Award honored established scholars for the 10th time in 2019. This panel will serve to further lend visibility to the individual award winners but also emphasize the impact of feminist scholarship on communication and media studies. The panel will further serve as a discussion forum that will form the basis of a book chapter in an edited volume that will highlight the first ten Teresa Award winners. The panel discussion will bring Teresa Award winners into conversations across subfields and individual accomplishments to chart out past and future paths of feminist scholarship in communication and media studies.

Health Misinformation: A Global Threat,Panel Session,Health Communication,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,CC G CENTRAL C (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:25|400-word Panel Rationale:In 2018, Nature reported that the biggest risk to global health was viral misinformation. In fact, increasingly medical researchers, scientists, and governments are reporting that misinformation about medical conditions could be the greatest threat humankind faces in combating illness. Moreover, such spreading of misinformation has ethical implications, which will be discussed in one of the proposed presentations. We are already seeing such reactions around vaccinations. In nations like New Zealand, misinformation regarding vaccinations has spread for many years and led to a large portion of the population not being vaccinated against the measles. In 2019, an outbreak of measles has occurred in the Auckland area. One of the proposed presentations, from New Zealand, will discuss this situation and how misinformation is linked to the spread of measles in New Zealand. Health misinformation has also been linked to numerous misunderstandings surrounding treatments of HIV/AIDS. Particularly in South Africa, the population does not adequately understand how the disease is treated, and is often misinformed on the disease, its treatment, and prognosis. One of the proposed presentations tackles this issue. How images are shared to portray a health event is another way in which misinformation can be spread. Increasingly photos and images taken by disaster victims are used by the media to tell stories of disasters. However, how the media frame these photos or images can often be done in a way to shape a particular narrative that does not tell an “honest” story of the events. This form of health misinformation is discussed by one of the proposed presentations. Finally, many governments are reluctant to acknowledge that Lyme or other tick-borne diseases are a serious health risk. In particular there is serious debate over whether the diseases are chronic or non-chronic in nature. This family of diseases is often difficult to diagnose and thus governments and health board report the diseases as non-existent. However, in Europe, North America, and Australaisia reports of the diseases are on the rise among advocates and scientists. The final proposed presentations discusses how media and governments spread and/or suppress information on Lyme and tick-borne diseases. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Mohan Jyoti Dutta, Massey U",Vaccine Hesitancy in New Zealand,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,D.

This was recognised by the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP24, in December 2018, when it endorsed the first-ever international ‘Sports for Climate Action Framework’ (SCAF) (United Nations Climate Change 2018). Featuring signatories such as the International Olympic Committee, Formula E Motor Racing and the World Surf League, the SCAF articulates the impact of climate change on sporting activities and the ability of professional sport to ‘promote greater environmental responsibility’ by engaging ‘billions of fans’ and ‘large audiences’ (pp. 3, 5). Communication through broadcast channels, social media, events, associations, venues, clubs, teams and athletes forms a key plank of the SCAF (p. 5) and underpins the assertion that sport is a ‘strong platform’ with ‘a unique power to inspire a wider societal change’ (pp. 3, 9). In recognising this capacity, however, the SCAF also highlights a significant dilemma in the deployment of this power; sport events and activities also generate their own ‘considerable’ environmental and climate impacts through ‘travel, energy use, construction, catering, and so on’ (p. 3). It is a timely observation given, for example, the increasing profile and work of Australia’s peak sport and environment body, the Sports Environment Alliance, members of which include Cricket Australia, Netball Australia, Golf Australia and the Australian Football League (Hutchins & Lester 2017), and recent news stories warning of disruption to the nation’s summer sporting calendar caused by extreme heat and drought (Martin 2019). This panel from the International Environmental Communication Association, and complementing the ICA Sports Communication Interest Group, explores media sport as a ‘platform’ for environmental communication – that is, a sphere of activity and practice that reaches ‘massive audiences’ and presents ‘new opportunities’ to communicate ‘messages and pathways to persuade’ (Price 2008, pp. 87-88). The understanding, features and potential of this platform require examination into the range of environmental messages communicated by media sport, and how these messages reflect and negotiate the dilemma of promoting environmental awareness through popular events and activities that also generate their own significant ecological footprints.

It does so by reflecting on research on the lives of people seeking to enter into or have managed to enter cultural and creative industries. This includes analysis of dynamics of selection and support in higher education and conservatory institutions as well as in CCIs themselves, the balancing of multiple jobs and internships (inside and outside the cultural and creative sector) and the way in which aspiring cultural workers use digital technologies (such as video uploading sites and social media) in order to pursue recognition, inclusion and success. The panel consists of researchers who are working on questions of race, cultural production and digital technologies, but it builds upon and transcends previous research by examining the limitations of existing industry understandings of ‘diversity’. The first two papers in this panel consider more directly the issue of cultural education and how racialised minorities ‘prepare’ for work in the creative/cultural industries. Francesca Sobande’s paper considers how Black British women who aspire to work in media experience alienation in higher education and as a response self-educate via the opportunities provided for by digital technologies. David Hesmondhalgh in his paper focuses on specialist ‘training’ institutions within the wider history of cultural education in the UK and explores the dynamics of racism that shape who and who does not get selected, and who such institutions are open to in the first place. The following papers then focus on racialised minorities on the cusp of entering, or who have just entered the core cultural industries. In her paper Sherene Idriss explores how Australian women from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds attempt to create ‘meaningful work’ in response to the racialised, gendered and class forms of oppression that they invariably experience. Anamik Saha’s paper explores the experiences of ‘writers of colour’ trying to get published in a moment when the publishing industry is desperate for more ‘diversity’ and the extent to which this represents real progress. Together the papers provide an account of the dynamics of racism, and intersections of sexism and classism in the CCIs and preparatory centres that constrain, though at times enable, the access of racial and ethnic minorities into the media. |Co-Sponsorship:Ethnicity and Race in Communication,Media Industry Studies|Additional Information:","Participant: David Hesmondhalgh, U of Leeds;Participant: Sherene Idriss, Deakin U;Chairs: Anamik Saha, Goldsmiths, U of London;Participant: Francesca Sobande, Cardiff U",Black Women's Media and Cultural Studies (Self)Education,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,F.

Francesca Sobande’s paper considers how Black British women who aspire to work in media experience alienation in higher education and as a response self-educate via the opportunities provided for by digital technologies. David Hesmondhalgh in his paper focuses on specialist ‘training’ institutions within the wider history of cultural education in the UK and explores the dynamics of racism that shape who and who does not get selected, and who such institutions are open to in the first place. The following papers then focus on racialised minorities on the cusp of entering, or who have just entered the core cultural industries. In her paper Sherene Idriss explores how Australian women from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds attempt to create ‘meaningful work’ in response to the racialised, gendered and class forms of oppression that they invariably experience. Anamik Saha’s paper explores the experiences of ‘writers of colour’ trying to get published in a moment when the publishing industry is desperate for more ‘diversity’ and the extent to which this represents real progress. Together the papers provide an account of the dynamics of racism, and intersections of sexism and classism in the CCIs and preparatory centres that constrain, though at times enable, the access of racial and ethnic minorities into the media. |Co-Sponsorship:Ethnicity and Race in Communication,Media Industry Studies|Additional Information:","Participant: David Hesmondhalgh, U of Leeds;Participant: Sherene Idriss, Deakin U;Chairs: Anamik Saha, Goldsmiths, U of London;Participant: Francesca Sobande, Cardiff U",Doing ‘Meaningful’ Work: Political Economies of Storytelling Among Racialised Women in the Creative Industries,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,S.

Negotiating Ethnic Inequality and Everyday Racism in Cultural and Creative Industries,Panel Session,Popular Communication,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Surfer's Paradise 2 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The project investigates dynamics and understandings of ethnic and racial inequality and ‘diversity’ in contemporary Western cultural and creative industries (CCIs). It does so by reflecting on research on the lives of people seeking to enter into or have managed to enter cultural and creative industries. This includes analysis of dynamics of selection and support in higher education and conservatory institutions as well as in CCIs themselves, the balancing of multiple jobs and internships (inside and outside the cultural and creative sector) and the way in which aspiring cultural workers use digital technologies (such as video uploading sites and social media) in order to pursue recognition, inclusion and success.

Reconciling Past Injustices: Media and National Inquiries as ‘Critical Conversations’,Panel Session,Global Communication and Social Change,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Coolangatta 3 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel examines the global media dimensions of national commissions of inquiry and their capacity to advance social change. Bringing together scholars in journalism, critical listening, Indigenous studies, media and policy, the panel will showcase contemporary scholarship in this under-researched domain of communication studies. In recent years, post-colonial societies have confronted and sought to reconcile the contemporary impacts of State policies and past injustices by constituting national commissions of inquiry. Royal Commissions, Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, and national inquiries represent an opportunity for national-level reflection, truth-seeking and public discussion. They often become a touchstone of national debate - a national ‘critical conversation’ that can lead to profound legal and political change and can significantly shift the national discourse and shape understanding of a nation’s most intractable issues. We conceptualise royal commissions as a national listening exercise, whereby the state bears witness to individual experiences of past injustice. The changing media environment is fundamental to these efforts to reconcile past injustices. News media can expose crimes and bring perpetrators to justice, and can shine light on practices that had been hidden, or ignored, by the global media and governments, while social media advocacy plays an increasingly important role in networking social movements and shaping the national discussion. There is also substantial interaction among commissions of inquiry through digital technologies and international social media networks, but there has been little academic attention on the global implications of this increasingly common form of intervention. For example, Wright et al. (2017) have identified a ‘global chain of inquiry’ around abuses against children, with inquiries in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway confronting the abuse of children in colonial contexts. Despite the rapid growth and international significance of national Commissions of Inquiry, there has been very little examination of the role of a changing media in the inquiry process, with cross-national comparison even less common. The panel speaks to the ICA 2020 conference theme of Open Communication by paying particular attention to the practices of ‘open justice’ that drive best practice in constituting a national commission of inquiry. A transformed, digital and globalised media landscape calls for a new approach to understanding the significance of commissions of inquiry in the contemporary era. What does the global digital media environment mean for how inquiries are commissioned, structured, and executed? And does it enhance the capacity for inquiries to bring justice for victims of past injustice? |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Kerry McCallum, U of Canberra",Media Ethics and the ‘Global Chain of Inquiry’,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,K.

They often become a touchstone of national debate - a national ‘critical conversation’ that can lead to profound legal and political change and can significantly shift the national discourse and shape understanding of a nation’s most intractable issues. We conceptualise royal commissions as a national listening exercise, whereby the state bears witness to individual experiences of past injustice. The changing media environment is fundamental to these efforts to reconcile past injustices. News media can expose crimes and bring perpetrators to justice, and can shine light on practices that had been hidden, or ignored, by the global media and governments, while social media advocacy plays an increasingly important role in networking social movements and shaping the national discussion. There is also substantial interaction among commissions of inquiry through digital technologies and international social media networks, but there has been little academic attention on the global implications of this increasingly common form of intervention. For example, Wright et al. (2017) have identified a ‘global chain of inquiry’ around abuses against children, with inquiries in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway confronting the abuse of children in colonial contexts. Despite the rapid growth and international significance of national Commissions of Inquiry, there has been very little examination of the role of a changing media in the inquiry process, with cross-national comparison even less common. The panel speaks to the ICA 2020 conference theme of Open Communication by paying particular attention to the practices of ‘open justice’ that drive best practice in constituting a national commission of inquiry. A transformed, digital and globalised media landscape calls for a new approach to understanding the significance of commissions of inquiry in the contemporary era. What does the global digital media environment mean for how inquiries are commissioned, structured, and executed? And does it enhance the capacity for inquiries to bring justice for victims of past injustice? |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Kerry McCallum, U of Canberra",Unsettling Apologies: How Racialised Hierarchies of Media Attention Whitewash Injustice,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,T.

Sharing Best Practices in Facilitating Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Improving Intergroup Relations,Panel Session,Intergroup Communication,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Scholarship related to acculturation and intergroup communication continues to be of keen interest to researchers across various disciplines, such as communication, cross-cultural psychology, sociology, linguistics, business, and gerontology. Despite insights generated from research in a myriad of contexts, we are yet to address the question of how to best harness insights from diverse research approaches and methodologies to translate theories into best practice to improve human relations and people’s lives in innovative ways. The proposed panel fills in this knowledge gap by bringing academic researchers and practitioners together to practice theories and theorize practice. This panel features 4 papers, authored or co-authored by 7 contributors from 5 different institutions. The 4 presenters are: Young Yun Kim (University of Oklahoma), a world leading researcher in intercultural and intergroup communication; Rachyl Pines (University of California Santa Barbara), an emerging prominent early career researcher in the field of intergroup and health communication, Shuang Liu (University of Queensland), an internationally recognized researcher in ageing and migration; and Patricia Golledge (Diversicare, Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland), an industry leader, with 30 years of experience in community aged care services. In addition, the Chair, Ling Chen (Hong Kong Baptist University), is a well-known senior researcher in intercultural communication. The four presentations showcase best practices in the area of cross-cultural adaptation and intergroup communication. Kim’s paper argues that cross-cultural adaptation is a bilateral and reciprocal process involving efforts by both immigrants and the host community, and offers insights into fostering mutuality and partnership between immigrants and host community. Golledge and Lindstrom’s paper presents an interactive online home safety program, named Multicultural Interactive Planning Solutions, which they developed to empower older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to design their future homes, taking into consideration of potential decline in health and mobility. The paper by Pines, Jones, and Sheeran explores challenges in healthcare interactions in multilingual contexts. Liu’s paper delves into the role of private gardens as a transnational space in maintaining cultural identity continuity of older migrants in Australia. The four presentations collectively contribute to translating theories into best practices to improve the lives of people in innovative ways. This panel speaks to the ICA 2020 theme of Open communication by addressing the question of how we can create open communication platforms to enable scholars and practitioners to develop best practices and improve policies to facilitate cross-cultural adaptation and improve intergroup relations. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Ling Chen, Hong Kong Bapstist U",Fostering Mutuality and Partnership: Adaptive Efforts by and for Immigrants,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,Y.

Visual Intimacy and Surveillance,Panel Session,Visual Communication Studies,24-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Southport 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Networked visual technologies, such as mobile camera phones, are an integral part of everyday life worlds, in co-present as well as in remote communication settings. These networked visual technologies are particularly valued for the bodily and emotional connections they allow for and are thus considered essential for creating and maintaining intimacy and close connection with co-present and distant others. Moreover, current networked visual devices are considered intimate objects themselves and are often carried close to one’s body. While they are used particularly for visual intimate encounters, these technologies have always been also used for surveillance purposes. Recently, practices of visual intimacy and surveillance are ever more entwined. Addressing these ambivalences the panel focuses on entanglements of mobile and networked visual technologies with intimacy and surveillance, that urge for critical assessment. This visual data collection is addressed very critically under the rubrics of surveillance capitalism, dataveillance, data colonialism, and data justice, but it remains less explored how these visual “surveillant assemblages” (Haggerty & Ericson, 2000) intersect with forms of intimacy. The first paper argues that intimacy and surveillance enabled by visual technologies, at a first glance, seem to be different, even opposing concepts. Based on interdisciplinary conceptual work, the talk elaborates on components of intimacy within surveillance as well as on the surveillance components in intimacy practices, showing their various entanglements. The second talk illustrates that the development of early mobile camera phones and the implementation of 'boarding with your face' technologies at airports both relied on expanding the horizon of visual intimacy as a way to connect to distant others. Here, intimate emotional connections are coupled with forms of surveillance, that are not always clear to situated actors themselves. The third paper discusses visual practices of control and surveillance in instant messaging services based on an ethnographic analysis conducted in Mexico. Here both intimate surveillance practices and the mostly hidden but fundamental role of private corporations in gathering and handling data are brought to the fore. In the fourth paper visual boundary work, forms of intimacy and phatic communities are discussed in terms of the visual access they provide, which couples practices of intimacy with those discussed within surveillance. Based on empirical analyses of “iconic” examples of surveillance camera videos and their respective film stills, the final paper examines both the production of online surveillance videos, and their particular aesthetic qualities and implications for journalistic, political and social networked contexts. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Edgar Gomez Cruz, U of New South Wales;Chairs: Asko Lehmuskallio, U of Tampere;Participant: Asko Lehmuskallio, U of Tampere;Chairs: Katharina Lobinger, U della Svizzera italiana;Participant: Katharina Lobinger, U della Svizzera italiana;Participant: Marion Mueller, U Trier;Participant: Patricia Prieto Blanco, University of Brighton;Participant: Rebecca Venema, U della Svizzera italiana",The Intimacy of Surveillance and Surveillance in Intimacy: Discerning Conceptual Entanglements,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,R.

Based on empirical analyses of “iconic” examples of surveillance camera videos and their respective film stills, the final paper examines both the production of online surveillance videos, and their particular aesthetic qualities and implications for journalistic, political and social networked contexts. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Edgar Gomez Cruz, U of New South Wales;Chairs: Asko Lehmuskallio, U of Tampere;Participant: Asko Lehmuskallio, U of Tampere;Chairs: Katharina Lobinger, U della Svizzera italiana;Participant: Katharina Lobinger, U della Svizzera italiana;Participant: Marion Mueller, U Trier;Participant: Patricia Prieto Blanco, University of Brighton;Participant: Rebecca Venema, U della Svizzera italiana",Video Rules the World!

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Responsible Terrorism Coverage: An Introduction to Data Sets and Open-Source Software Packages,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Stradbroke Room - Session (Star Pool Level),"400-word Panel Rationale:Journalists are often confronted with a dilemma when covering terrorism. While citizens need to be informed about terror attacks certain modes of terrorism coverage can be harmful to society. The media can perpetuate the messages that terrorists want to convey, fuel dangerous emotions such as fear and anger and exclude so-called suspect communities. Consequently, journalists need to be aware of these different modes of terrorism coverage and their potential consequences to be able to report in responsible ways. While there is a rich body of case-study based research analyzing how the media reports on specific terror events, comparative and longitudinal analyses of terrorism coverage are rare. This kind of research is necessary to identify larger patterns in terrorism coverage across time, and to gain a deeper understanding of how the media covers different types of terror events. The workshop’s aim is to start a conversation on how open science and computational methods can help in expanding our knowledge on terrorism coverage and ultimately be used to develop a research agenda on responsible terrorism coverage. Part of this discussion is how we can measure various elements of terrorism coverage, focusing in particular on computational content analysis methods. At the same time, sharing our data and instruments can increase the transparency of the research process, make it possible to reproduce our results and enable colleagues to expand, supplement and challenge our instruments and findings. In line with this year’s conference theme, the workshop is centered around the release of research data and open-source software developed over the past two years as part of the Responsible Terrorism Coverage project (ResTeCo). After a brief outline of our research agenda, we will introduce the newly released data sets spanning across more than 60 years of terrorism news coverage and open-source tools that can be used to extract various kinds of textual properties. In a hands-on workshop, attendees will then have the opportunity to look at the data and try out the different software packages themselves. The workshop aims to bring together international scholars from various ICA divisions and interest groups such as political communication, journalism and computational methods. There are no formal requirements for participation. Prospective attendees are recommended to bring a laptop with a running R environment and are invited to contact the session chair via email prior to the ICA conference and suggest potential discussion topics.|Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Marc Jungblut, LMU Munich;Chairs: Scott Althaus, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Chairs: Wouter van Atteveldt, Vrije U Amsterdam;Chairs: Hartmut Wessler, U Mannheim;Chairs: Chung-hong Chan, Mannheimer Zentrum für Europäische Sozialforschung;Chairs: Kasper Welbers, Vrije U Amsterdam",,,,,,,
"BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Internationalizing Academic Standards: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access for Early-Career Scholars",Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:ICA leadership supports the IDEA as the core value of our community, and aims to promote this regarding the activities of teaching, research, scholarship, and praxis in the communication discipline. SECAC is planning this BSW to bring together young academics who are willing to share their idea about this great initiative and find practical ways to “make it work.” SECAC has heard from our Student Members regarding several issues related IDEA, and we hope that this BSW will be an open place to discuss the topics including: - Why do we talk about “Internationalization,” here and now? - What is the role of Internationalization Liaison? What can we collaborate with them in our division/interest group? - How can we promote “internationalization” in teaching and research? In the classroom? In a fieldwork? Networking with other scholars? What about publishing in non-English? - How can we provide more IDEA for young scholars from the global south? - What is the ICA regional conference, and how can we get involved? This BSW will therefore provide a forum for students and early-career scholars to discuss how to promote ICA’s core value - IDEA in their teaching and research as well as in academia. A goal of this workshop is for participants with diverse cultural/regional/academic backgrounds to collaboratively develop an idea about the IDEA and gather practical suggestions for the better future of academia. The outcomes of this Blue Sky Workshop will lead to SECAC’s immediate action to increase the IDEA for young scholars and will be relayed through the SECAC section of the Newsletter to increase awareness and continue the discussion on these high-importance topics. Tentative Speakers One of current/former ICA Board at Large members Seyram Avle (Assistant Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst) Ido Ramati (Minerva Post-Doctoral Fellow, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Former SECAC) Mohan Dutta (Provost’s Chair Professor, National University of Singapore) Target Group Former/current Internationalization Liaisons and SECRs of divisions/interest groups Young scholars from the global south Anyone who is interested in IDEA Preparation No prior experience or knowledge of “internationalization” or the “IDEA” is required to participate in this BSW, which should lead into an open conversation among participants about the culture of academia in Communication. The participants will have the opportunity to ask questions to the speakers as well as share their own experiences with issues related to the IDEA in academia.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Opening Our Communication: Reaching Across Disciplines and Engaging the Public,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"400-word Panel Rationale:In keeping with the ICA 2020 theme of Open Communication, this workshop focuses on how this year’s theme asks us to develop best practices to create open communication. Yet what does this mean for individual projects we are currently pursing? This workshop aims to collaboratively identify strategies to improve the accessibility of our ideas to scholars outside our individual disciplines and to the public. By the end of this workshop participants will have practical strategies for opening the accessibility of their work to a broader audience. Participants are asked to bring works-in-progress, articles, manuscripts, theses, dissertations, white papers, etc. that they wish to get feedback on from fellow participants. Participants should consider bringing their personal computer or paper copies of their work. At the start of the session, participants will introduce themselves and briefly share the work that they have brought to the session and we will focus on collaboratively identifying qualities that make scholarship accessible across disciplines. Participants will then work in small groups, with diverse research interests, and focus on identifying particularly difficult aspects of their work that prevent easy understanding outside of their field. In these small groups, participants will identify ways they can improve the accessibility of their core ideas based on the opening conversation and the feedback in small groups. The remainder of the workshop will emphasize sharing work outside of academia to our communities, journalists, and the wider public. Participants will share writing tips and resources to improve the clarity, transparency, and accessibility of their work to non-academic audiences. We will also identify outlets to share our work to the public, from social media platforms, journalistic outlets, and community engagement opportunities. |Expected Attendance:|Co-Sponsorship:Theme|Additional Information:","Chairs: Richelle Crotty, The U of Texas at Austin",Opening Our Communication: Reaching Across Disciplines and Engaging the Public,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,R.

These changes can manifest themselves in negative ways such as metric-driven journalism, fake news, or media silos. Correspondingly, however, these alterations in the media environment have had positive manifestations such as investigative forms of data journalism, an increase in user participation, or opportunities for users to enrich their media repertoires through more diverse sources. While being essentially ambivalent in their character, these examples express the extent to which public communication is currently being re-figured. The aim of this panel is to take a ‘figurational’ approach (Elias 1978) to empirical research on public communication. From this point of view ‘communicative figurations’ (Hepp/Hasebrink 2017) are – typically cross-media – interweaving patterns of communicative practices. A re-figuration considers the transformation of ‘communicative figurations’, that is, of actor constellations, media-related practices, and the frames of relevance for certain social domains. The panel will discuss pioneer journalism as a driving force in the transformation of the figurations of news production, the shifting figurations between journalism and its audience through media-technological change and the consequential changes in the public connection of individuals through their media repertoires. By contrasting these three perspectives, the aim of the panel is to gain better insight into the re-figuration of public communication in times of deep mediatization. In sum, the session will discuss how a figurational approach allows us to better understand contemporary transformations in public communications. References: Couldry, N., & Hepp, A. (2017).

Journalism Epistemology and Power,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC U ROOM 5 (GCCEC Upper),"Expected Attendance:150|400-word Panel Rationale:Journalism and journalists in western democracies where English is the dominant language are responding to a range of serious concerns across an array of domains, many of which have been deemed as “in crisis” by pundits and scholars. Examples include: market failure and labor precarity, violence by citizens and police, mislabeling of “fake news” by a sitting U.S. president and others, and mainstream newsrooms that do not reflect the diversity of the publics they serve (or aim to serve). Real-time feedback from increasingly participatory, powerful, and diverse publics and pressures to stay current with rapid and constant technological change have also contributed to professional and industry challenges and 'crisis-talk,' marking a distinction between the journalisms of the pre-digital eras and today. These multiple overlapping crises in journalism have been largely circumscribed as stemming from either economic decline and/ or technological disruption, limiting the possibility for discussion of wider and often prior challenges to the current state of journalism (Zelizer, 2015). Our intention in this panel is to conjoin wider conversations that have been quite distinct, bringing persistent critiques of news coverage, journalistic approaches and methodologies related to race, gender, intersectionality, and settler-colonialism alongside economic decline and technological changes. We complicate the notion of crisis, which has tended to be limited and ahistorical in its representations of the problems, causes and solutions of journalism’s present. In contrast, we situate concerns about technology and economics alongside chronic issues related to power and epistemology in order to analyze gaps and exclusions. Understanding what journalism can and should do— its limits and possibilities— is essential to imagining new contours for how journalism might respond to what Callison and Young (2020) term a digital reckoning taking place at a time when quality reflexive journalism also matters. This panel opens up these discussions to move both beyond and beside a defense of journalism to get at “a deeper set of historiographical problems” (Carey 1974) in order to understand the current moment in journalism. This panel takes as its premise that multiple journalisms are emerging fuelled in part by the possibilities afforded by digital platforms. This emergence in many ways challenges conclusions that journalism is in a technological and/or economic crisis only. Instead, it presents a range of possibilities for how journalism might repair, reform, and transform professional norms and practices, and respond to persistent critique offered by diverse publics and marginalized communities who have often not been served well and/or harmed by journalism. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Alfred Hermida, U of British Columbia","Repair, Reform, Transformation: Journalism’s Possibilities",11:00 AM,11:00 AM,C.

Law Through the Lens,Panel Session,Visual Communication Studies,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:This panel brings together research in visual communication, journalism, information science, the law and criminology to examine how, under which conditions and to what ends different visual media function as legal evidence. The law has long been an institution that considers words to be the best vehicle for transporting its logic. It associates words with reason, systematic thinking and deliberation, pushing aside the value of images as a mode of information relay that works differently from words. As legal scholar Neal Feigenson (2014) writes, “the infrastructures of legal knowledge have been generally unreceptive to pictures” (p. 13). When used, the law has insisted that images need the words of witnesses to anchor their legal meaning. Yet, as visual communication research has long shown, images and words operate via complementary, but different, logics that need to be taken seriously. This is especially important at times when the law is turning to images ever more for multiple reasons and purposes despite the lack of clear standards that guide visual information creation, processing, access and use in different legal settings. The four papers on this panel thus offer insights into emerging information policy questions involving visuals. Ristovska unpacks the tension between doctrine and practice surrounding the use of visual evidence at the U.S. Supreme Court. Bock looks at the recording rights and responsibilities in an era of smartphones and body cameras. Newell then examines the police and public perceptions of video footage of violent interactions. Lastly, Porter turns to the challenges with facial identification systems that are rapidly adopted by law enforcement agencies around the world. Together, the four papers on this panel emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary scholarship that addresses the role of visual information in the law head on, unpacking why any neglects to do so may come at the expense of human rights and civil liberties.

On The ‘Grand Narrative’ of Mass Communication Theory and Research,Panel Session,Mass Communication,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC G CENTRAL C (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Throughout the history of mass communication theory and research, claims have been made that ‘mass’ media’ ‘communication’ are concepts that possibly do not fit the contemporary media environment (anymore). Especially following rapid developments in new information and communication technologies, scholars postulated as far back as the 1980s that a paradigm shift in communication science. The introduction of GSM phones and the Web in the early 1990s amplified predictions about the end of mass media and communication.

However, after studying ‘old’ and ‘new’ media as well as offline and online communication practices over several decades, and considering the various ways in which media devices, institutions and (networks of) people adapt to this constantly changing context, we have to conclude that ‘mass communication’ has remained (or returned as) a significant way to make sense of our media environment. That said, existing theories, models, and approaches to media and mass communication cannot be seamlessly deployed to describe and explain the current state of affairs. 

Rather than tweaking, editing and perhaps upgrading all kinds of more or less established theories and concepts used in the study of mass media and communication, the purpose of our panel is to return to the fundamental ‘grand narrative’ of our discipline. What is the study of mass communication, and what can or perhaps even should it be to accommodate the truly mediatized and globalized environment within which we live? 

The papers in this panel represent four distinct perspectives. Barbie Zelizer develops the historical argument that notions of ‘mass’ media and communication should remain central to our field despite the individualizing tendencies of the digital. Terry Flew follows up on this argument by showing the application and continued relevance of the ‘mass’ concept in the context of data and AI-based approaches to the study of social media. In the spirit of the ‘open communication’ conference theme, Cristina Archetti then pushes the field forward by suggesting – based on two research projects – that the study of ‘mass’ communication needs creativity as it can be shown to make unique theoretical and methodological contributions to the field. Herman Wasserman closes the panel with a consideration of the fundamental question of who the ‘mass’ in ‘mass communication’ is. His presentation moves the debate beyond issues of diversity and inclusion toward a sustainable global reorientation of the field.

"Open Access, Open Communications: Opportunities and Challenges for Open Access Journals in Communications",Panel Session,Sponsored Sessions,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC G HALL 3 - MULLET (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:25|400-word Panel Rationale:In the last two decades, open access (OA) publishing has secured for itself a small but growing niche in the field of scholarly publishing. OA publishing emerged in response to the demand that scholarly research, often supported by public funds and reviewed and edited by unpaid volunteers, should be freely and easily accessible to the scholarly community and the public. It gained traction because of the proliferation of journal titles and their exponentially rising subscription rates. OA advocates came together in public statements of intent such as the Bethesda Statement (dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4725199), Budapest OA Initiative (www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org), and Berlin Declaration (openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration). In November 2017, the Association of American Universities and the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities jointly recommended FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) access to research findings and data. Yet, formidable challenges remain. OA journals have struggled to find a sustainable business model; deprived of subscription fees from readers and research libraries, OA journals have resorted to either publication fees charged to authors and/or subsidies in the form of university or government agency support, sponsorship by professional associations, foundation support, or other sources. The former option—author fees—naturally tends to reduce submissions to the journals. Fierce opposition from for-profit publishers prevent the formation of consortia of OA publications to promote reciprocal access and sharing of research findings and data. Institutional repository and copyright retention mandates continue to evolve. Also, since most OA journals are also online, a residual prejudice continues to act against publication in OA journals in promotion and tenure evaluations. In this context, and in view of ICA’s 2020 conference theme of Open Communication, we aim to bring together a number of leading OA journals in the field of communications and information studies, to discuss problems confronting OA journals, share best practices, advocate for solutions, and to evolve a common platform of action, if feasible. The following individuals/journals have indicated a willingness to participate: • Jeffrey Blevins - Democratic Communique • Benedetta Brevini - The Political Economy of Communication • Sumit Narula - Journal of Content, Community and Communication • Md Naser – American Communication Journal • Chris Russill – Canadian Journal of Communication • Kevin Sanson – Media Industries • Amit Schejter and Krishna Jayakar – Journal of Information Policy The Institute for Information Policy (IIP) at Penn State University, the organizer of this workshop, has conducted workshops twice a year since 2011 on various aspects of information and telecommunications policy, several at previous ICA conferences. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Amit Schejter, Ben-Gurion U of the Negev;Moderator: Krishna Jayakar, Pennsylvania State U;Participant: Jeffrey Blevins, U of Cincinnati;Participant: Benedetta Brevini, U of Sydney;Participant: Sumit Narula, Amity School of Communication;Participant: Md Naser, California State U, Bakersfield;Participant: Chris Russill, Carleton U;Participant: Kevin Sanson, Queensland U of Technology",,,,,,,

Recent research in this field has been focused on governments' use of online disinformation campaigns and computational methods to manipulate or distract the flow of information and public opinion (Marwick & Lewis, 2017; Woolley & Howard, 2017; Tucker, 2018). Research has shed light on “zombie” election-monitoring groups that threaten the credibility of elections in democratic regimes (Merloe, 2015; Lazer et al., 2018), the widespread use of political bots as in Russia and Venezuela (Forelle, 2015; Woolley, 2016), as well as engineered social media content by the fifty-cent army in China (King et al., 2017). All of these phenomena have helped advance our knowledge of propaganda in the computational age, in turn improving our understanding of political communication processes. At the same time, the multi-faceted affordances of digital technologies and more powerful communicative tools posit new challenges to political leaders when it comes to disseminating propaganda. The information proliferation and interconnectedness of online content may draw the locus of propaganda away from its political intention (Schmitt et al., 2018). The fragmentation of media activities through communicative tools like mobile phones complicates the long-term process of setting and maintaining political agendas (Reeves et al., 2019). Rumors and disinformation broadcasted at scale may unintentionally damage the credibility of the government (Jowett & O’Donnell, 2018). New theoretical and empirical questions arise: how does online political propaganda disseminated through digital technologies function? What types of political goals do political actors hope to achieve? How are they aided or hampered by digital technologies? Besides disinformation, what other propaganda strategies are employed in democratic and authoritarian regimes? This panel brings together research using a number of different approaches to answer these questions. Our panel features an array of scholars from seven institutions (Free University of Berlin, Hong Kong University, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Princeton University, Stanford University, University of Texas at Austin, University of Zurich) who study propaganda in the digital age across diverse national settings and on a number of different digital platforms.

Methodologically, it assembles works that employ a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods, including observational analysis, online experiments, ethnographic fieldwork, and interviews.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Discussant: Frank Esser, U of Zürich;Chairs: King-wa Fu, The U of Hong Kong;Discussant: Philip Howard, Oxford University;Participant: Chenyan Jia, U of Texas at Austin;Chairs: Yingdan Lu, Stanford U;Participant: Sergey Sanovich, Princeton University;Discussant: Edson Tandoc, Nanyang Technological U;Participant: Thomas Zerback, U of Zürich;Participant: Yuner Zhu, U of Hong Kong",Preparing Citizens Against Astroturfing: Psychological Reactance as a Mediator of Inoculation Message Effects,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,M.

"Short-Form Parallel Universes: Affordances, Activity, and Culture of TikTok and Douyin",Panel Session,Popular Communication,24-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 2 (Star),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Short-form video platforms, featuring video content between 15 and 60 seconds long, are immensely popular in China but failed to take root in the West, as illustrated by Twitter shutting down rising short video platform, Vine, in 2016. It was not until the launch of TikTok, an internationalized version of Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin, that short form popularity began to spread in the West. Within two years since its launch in 2017, TikTok has emerged to rival digital platforms like Instagram and Facebook, with over one billion downloads in 150 markets worldwide and 75 languages. This panel seeks to understand the cultural and sociopolitical implications of the flourishing short video platforms. Developed and owned by Chinese tech company, Bytedance, TikTok and Douyin appear virtually identical at face value. Closer critical examination reveals the subtle distinctions in content, application infrastructures, and platform culture between the two. This panel takes a balanced approach to interrogating TikTok and Douyin with presentations from a diverse group of scholars looking at the two apps separately and side-by-side. Our first panelist discusses the parallel paths in development taken by TikTok and Douyin that have led both platforms to thrive in diametrically opposed markets and regulatory environments. Using Douyin as an example, the second panelist focuses on how traditional localism is activated, mediated, and redefined on short-form video platforms. In discussing TikTok, our third panelist considers the ways mixed race young people share their lived experiences and practice call-out culture, to understand the visual ecologies of activism on the app. Returning to Douyin, our third panelist will describe the way ‘playful patriotism’, in the form of strategically deployed nationalistic content, maintains connections with audiences in China while appeasing state regulators. Panelists from our final paper examine how the short video culture on TikTok shapes and challenges science communication, via examining science and pseudoscience memes. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Crystal Abidin, Curtin U;Participant: Xu Chen, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Mike Schäfer, University of Zurich;Chairs: David Bondy Valdovinos Kaye, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Wei Wang, Shanghai Jiao Tong U;Participant: Jing Zeng, U of Zürich",Dancing in Chains: Parallel Platformization of Tiktok and Douyin,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,D.

So-called ‘foreign news’ has always been the most expensive part of traditional Western media operations and it affords ‘bragging rights’ to those wishing to claim cultural capital, exercise soft power or be taken seriously - either in the wider public sphere or more particularly in government and business circles (Murrell, 2019). But Western modes of reporting have shifted in recent years towards journalism created by, or in cooperation with reporters from the global South. The financing for many new media ventures is coming increasingly from philanthropic donors, NGOs, politically motivated organisations and – in some cases – state actors. The internet and social media have meant that international reporting can be unshackled from the tyranny of having Western ‘boots on the ground’ (Sambrook, 2010). The advent of social media platforms has also led to many new players circulating international news -- citizen journalists, eye-witnesses, academics, analysts, ‘research institutions,’ activists, interested parties, bots and mischief-makers. These new players may or may not be anywhere near the action, and this difficulty in trusting some of the sources goes part way to explaining the huge followings on social media of trusted brands – the Western and non-Western correspondents. Cheaper alternatives for accessing trusted news sources are found by hiring local reporters or freelancers from the global South (Evans & Bebawi, 2019; Salamon, 2019) instead of expensive reporters sent abroad and maintained in bureaux. These options are valuable because they deliver news from diverse cultural perspectives, outside of the global dominance paradigm (Murrell, 2019). If advocacy is not a problematic issue for some news platforms then NGOs, non-profit organisations (NPOs) and philanthropic funding offer growing resources for cash-strapped media, ‘in apparent acceptability to the profession’ (Powers, 2018). In particular such funding has been directed at the reporting of international development issues (Scott, Bunce & Wright, 2017) and investigative journalism in the Middle East (Bebawi, 2016). In some cases, news gathering is openly being funded by politically-interested NGOs, such as is currently happening with the reporting of North Korean stories by small, craft news agencies, funded from North America. And while most Western media organisations have been reducing their bureaux' footprint across the world, this has not been the case for one significant state-sponsored company from China, CGTN, which has set up significant reporting teams and production centres in Nairobi, Washington D.C., and London. |Co-Sponsorship:Journalism Studies|Additional Information:N/A","Chairs: Colleen Murrell, Dublin City U;Discussant: Chris Paterson, U of Leeds","International Reporting of the Global South, Brought to You by Australian Philanthropy",11:00 AM,11:00 AM,C.

Cheaper alternatives for accessing trusted news sources are found by hiring local reporters or freelancers from the global South (Evans & Bebawi, 2019; Salamon, 2019) instead of expensive reporters sent abroad and maintained in bureaux. These options are valuable because they deliver news from diverse cultural perspectives, outside of the global dominance paradigm (Murrell, 2019). If advocacy is not a problematic issue for some news platforms then NGOs, non-profit organisations (NPOs) and philanthropic funding offer growing resources for cash-strapped media, ‘in apparent acceptability to the profession’ (Powers, 2018). In particular such funding has been directed at the reporting of international development issues (Scott, Bunce & Wright, 2017) and investigative journalism in the Middle East (Bebawi, 2016). In some cases, news gathering is openly being funded by politically-interested NGOs, such as is currently happening with the reporting of North Korean stories by small, craft news agencies, funded from North America. And while most Western media organisations have been reducing their bureaux' footprint across the world, this has not been the case for one significant state-sponsored company from China, CGTN, which has set up significant reporting teams and production centres in Nairobi, Washington D.C., and London. |Co-Sponsorship:Journalism Studies|Additional Information:N/A","Chairs: Colleen Murrell, Dublin City U;Discussant: Chris Paterson, U of Leeds",Covering North Korea in a Post-Disruption Media Landscape,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,R.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Keep Communication’s Doors Open: Inclusive Mentoring and Pedagogy,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Stradbroke Room - Session (Star Pool Level),"400-word Panel Rationale:For the past few decades mentoring has moved from being a buzzword in a few select programs into a major institutional goal. From large corporations to small universities, leaders recognize the importance of those with more experience guiding junior employees and students. Colleges and universities have taken the lead nationwide in mentoring efforts, with many having exemplary peer mentoring programs for undergraduates, and some institutions deploying mentoring to support faculty and students. The discipline of communication has also begun to place more emphasis on mentoring. Yet, some populations (women of color and other minoritized people) do not always have access to networks or programs and are left on their own to navigate institutions and processes. That few women of color faculty inhabit academic spaces, including in Communication departments, creates additional challenges for students and faculty, who often lack mentors and yet carry the additional burden of mentoring. In this session, we seek to imagine what opening the door to our field might mean in terms of mentoring. We encourage a rich discussion to think through how to navigate institutional and cultural barriers in higher education. We examine, for example, the ways that women of color deploy feminist theory and pedagogy to address the gap in support and to push our discipline beyond its boundaries. We aim to help participants to develop a set of tools and best practices that they can use beyond this workshop. Organizers of this Blue Sky workshop include faculty who have started mentoring programs for first-generation students and graduate students, and women of color faculty as well as scholars recognized as change agents with mentoring and other awards. Planned schedule: Introduction: Background on mentoring Break-out groups: Identifying challenges and best practices Large group: Reporting back and identifying themes Large group: Planning next steps Requirements: We invite participants interested in the theme, specifically those with an interest and/or with demonstrated record of opening the doors of communication through mentoring under-represented students, faculty, or community members. Interested participants should submit a 1-page thematic statement to the chair(s). |Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Ralina Joseph, U of Washington;Chairs: Manoucheka Celeste, U of Florida;Discussant: Srividya Ramasubramanian, Texas A&M U;Discussant: Chantal Rozairo, Western Sydney U;Discussant: Angharad Valdivia, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Discussant: Myra Washington, U of New Mexico",,,,,,,
BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: Recoding Communication? Design Interventions in Infrastructural Politics,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"400-word Panel Rationale:Over the last several years, data and algorithms have become recognized as ways for macro actors to classify, analyze, and control individuals. These new circuits of power have become inextricably part of communication infrastructures, evident in public concern about online disinformation, harassment, and data-driven exclusion. In response, communication scholars have taken a range of approaches to integrate existing theories and scholarship with emerging theories of infrastructural power. For example, the 2018 ICA Preconference Design as Object, Design as Method: Making Critical Communication Future(s) built on earlier scholarship (Aakhus, 2007; Krippendorff, 2005) to synthesize theoretical traditions between communication and design. Drawing on activist traditions, Sasha Costanza-Chock’s (2018) notion of “design justice” employed an intersectional perspective to push back on domination of marginalized groups. Cultural scholars have interrogated how attempts to include under-represented groups in technology design have both a long historical arc (McIlwain, 2019), and can work counter to goals of diversity and inclusion (Dunbar-Hester, 2019). The common thread across these efforts is to consider how communication can make the design of communication technologies more democratic and equitable, in multiple senses, particularly by drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship on technology and power. Accordingly, this blue sky panel creates space for discussing empirical, theoretical, and interventionist efforts to understand the relationship between communication and design. We invite participants to join us to discuss and share their experiences with: Drawing on design literacies to create communication technologies that benefit historically marginalized communities. Co-creating communication infrastructures in collaboration with government. Interrogating the rhetoric of technology companies on design efforts that purport to work for the “public good.” Grassroots efforts to organize against technologically-mediated oppression. Organizational communication as a way to improve technology design. References Aakhus, M. (2007). Communication as Design.

Creating the Future: Popular Discourses of Innovation and Entrepreneurship,Panel Session,Popular Communication,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 2 (Star),"Expected Attendance:25|400-word Panel Rationale:Innovation is the mythology of our times. Calls to be more innovative permeate not just spaces of business and promotion, but all manner of institutions both public and private, which in recent years have roundly rejected “old” ways of doing things in favor of change and “disruption.” Likewise, recent decades have witnessed the transformation of entrepreneurship from a strategy employed by corporations to an overarching sensibility, as appropriate for Fortune 500 companies as it is for individuals laboring within the gig economy.

Hidden Labour in Media Industries,Panel Session,Media Industry Studies,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:Media scholars in recent years have shown a growing concern with traditionally uncredited, undercredited, and otherwise hidden forms of media labour across an expanded range of communication industries and national contexts. Advancing this agenda, this panel explores forms and meanings of submerged categories of media work for 20th and 21st century film and broadcasting industries in North America, Europe, and Australia. Inviting conversations that cut across multiple media, nations, and time periods, panellists grapple with challenges involved in rendering these hidden labour practices visible and bringing their meanings for and impacts on their respective industries out into the open. Raising a series of critical and methodological questions about means and implications of tracking these workers across their various institutional, technological, and geopolitical contexts, panellists seek to respect the specificity of the industries addressed while also opening broader conversations about preferred methods and implications of analysing these workers and labour practices within the field at large. Opening the panel, Robles uses a combination of archival methods and oral histories to reconstruct the otherwise forgotten careers of female workers responsible for program development on state-owned Mexican radio stations in the early 20th century. Shifting to television production, Bevan and VanCour use archival research to explore the role that unions have historically played in defining below-the-line work in this industry, with VanCour tracing the impact of expanding theatre unions on divisions of labour in mid-century US television and Bevan showing how union rules impacted transnational flows of workers in and out of the Australian television industry during the second half of the 20th century. Showing the value of large-scale numerical data sets, O’Regan uses four decades of census data to explore changing geographies and demographics in Australian broadcasting from the 1970s to present, while Sanson uses ethnographic research methods to highlight less glamorous forms of below-the-line labour in US, European, and Australian film industries and challenge assumptions of media work as inherently “creative” labour. From archival research and oral histories to statistical analysis and ethnographic research, these presenters showcase different methods for calling back into presence the diversity of underrepresented, uncredited, and unseen labourers who have populated historical and contemporary media across industries across the globe, expanding current research agendas and arguing for a more capacious definition of 20th and 21st century media work. |Co-Sponsorship:Communication History,Media Industry Studies|Additional Information:","Chairs: Alex Bevan, U of Queensland;Chairs: Shawn VanCour, University of California",The Woman Behind CZE: María Luis Ross and Mexico's Ministry of Public Education's Radio Station,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,S.

ICA Special Roundtable: Greening the Academy in Times of Climate Crisis,Roundtable proposal,Sponsored Sessions,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC G ARENA 1A (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:|Co-Sponsorship:|400-word Panel Rationale:In 2018, Sweden experienced its hottest summer in 262 years. A young Swedish girl frustrated with her government’s inaction skipped school to protest outside parliament with a home-made sign reading ‘School strike for the climate’ and a list of demands for immediate intervention to reduce carbon emissions. She was fifteen-year-old Greta Thunberg. What began as a solitary protest soon attracted attention on social media and sparked an international school strike movement that has seen millions across the globe marching for change. In the US, just one month before Greta began her strike, a Congress-appointed IPCC panel handed down its assessment of the impact of the climate crisis on the national economy. It found that “without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions annual losses is some economic sectors [were] projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century”. The report also warned that should temperatures increase above 1.5C, the economic ramifications will exceed previous projections. It declared we have just 12 years to ensure warming does not rise above 1.5 C. Beyond this point, the risk of weather events, drought, extreme heat and the resulting poverty for millions of people will be significantly higher. What is the role of the academy in addressing the climate crisis? Regular air travel for fieldwork, research and to meet at annual conferences feature in these discussions are just some of the multitude of consumption and waste consequences characteristic of being a 21st century academic. The development and maintenance of universities buildings as well as planning for sustainable campuses (and their vast use of highly energy consuming technologies and cloud services) is also a crucial concern. Divestment has also been pursued by academic organisations, seeking to shift university investments away from fossil fuel companies and their beneficiaries. What are the major challenges we face in greening the academy? How do we create an environmentally sustainable conference? What efforts have past and present conference organisers, committees and communities at conferences made to ensure our conference legacy aligns with positive and progressive environmental futures? What is our responsibility to the places we meet and the planet we inhabit? How can we support global movements of activities? How can we ensure and push universities to divest? These are some of the questions our panellists will address in this special session roundtable |Additional Information:","Chairs: Benedetta Brevini, U of Sydney;Participant: Claes de Vreese, U of Amsterdam;Participant: Jeff Niederdeppe, Cornell U;Participant: Bruno Takahashi, Michigan State U;Participant: Mary Savigar, Polity",,,,,,,

Open Data Meets Open Scholarship: Building an Interdisciplinary Research Agenda for Social Change,Panel Session,Theme,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Southport 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:100|400-word Panel Rationale:Globally, the open data/open government movement (a public-facing, adjacent field to Open Science/Communication) seeks to broaden access to public records and datasets, which are digitally accessible to a wide range of stakeholders—including elected officials, academics, civic technologists, journalists and the general public (Schrock, 2016). Ideally, these efforts heighten transparency among public stakeholders by providing intensified scrutiny on local government operations (Schrock and Shaffer, 2017). This information, in turn, empowers citizens and journalists in the decision-making process of local democracy (Baack, 2015). Open data initiatives have generated not only apps and visualizations to translate the data; they have also produced in-person gatherings such as town halls and hackathons designed to more deeply connect data communities (Author, 2017). Convening these publics in deep, deliberative dialogue around open data has proven difficult, however (Kreiss, 2015). Tactically, open data initiatives are heavily dependent upon civic participation from external audiences. Data analysis often requires high levels of computational knowledge. As a result, activating the general public around open data has been challenging, in that average citizens often lack the technical skills to interact with data in its rawest form, thereby restricting their ability to join the conversation (Author, 2019). At the same time, journalists have traditionally viewed their position as a watchdog on governmental activity, rather than as a collaborator in solving shared problems (Nerone, 2013). For newsworkers, participation in open data initiatives may necessitate transitions in their role perceptions and routines (Author, 2019). Beyond rallying public participation, open data initiatives also present ethical, legal and policy conundrums about platform interoperability, intellectual property and privacy rights. To date, the academic conversation around open data has been siloed within subdisciplines of communication scholarship. Expanding insights from a journalism studies-specific panel on open data in North America at the 2019 AEJMC conference, this ICA panel will assemble global scholars into a broader, interdisciplinary exchange around how open data can be unified across the field of communication. Researchers have a vital role to play in the open data movement, through not only profiling its evolution through communication scholarship, but in directly contributing our scholarly expertise to open data projects. Such public-facing engagement can, in its ideal construct, catalyze social change within the communities in which we live. We believe that this session will solidify a shared research agenda for communication scholarship on the open data movement and its future prospects for social change. References: Baack, S. (2015).

Varsity Blues: A Critical Assessment of Collegiate Esports,Panel Session,Game Studies,24-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:75|400-word Panel Rationale:The influence and scope of esports and competitive gaming are unquestionably on the rise. The industry has reached US$1 billion worldwide (Webb, 2019) with room for further growth and investment. New competitive games are released daily and enthusiasm by fans, celebrities and athletes alike is huge. While the commercial future of esports is bright, its operations and policies are much more opaque. The path to professionalism, sponsorship, coverage, and publication of content, especially in regard to class, labor and opportunity, lacks transparency and accessibility. Nowhere is this more visible than in collegiate athletics. Particularly in the US, publicity of esports has accelerated the construction of new student facilities, available scholarships, and the integration of competitive gaming into college life. At the same time, it is unclear how this industry will fully assimilate. Since regulatory bodies like the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Olympic National Committee have dismissed esports, its institutional infrastructure and economy, along with gaming’s cultural issues, have often been left to communications, media and game studies scholars to discern. Despite this, critical and cultural literature on collegiate esports is nascent (Reitman et al., 2019), while sports management has forged the majority of research (e.g. Pizzo et al., 2019; Schaeperkoetter et al., 2017). Consequently, scrutiny of its effects on professionalization, institutionalization within higher education, the relationship between collegiate gaming and sports communities and the cognitive development of esports players is absent. These concerns dovetail with game studies scholars’ recent calls for a critical assessment of student, faculty and administrative labor to integrate esports into the traditional sports industry and culture, while profits revert to publishers (AnyKey, 2019). We propose to open a dialogue around crucial cultural esports’ issues in universities. Building on an international body of research from Australia, the United States and Europe, the presenters will examine both empirically and critically the legitimacy, access, motivation and labor of college amateur and varsity players as well as professionals. Since the speakers are affiliated with institutions heavily invested in the promotion of esports, the panel will act in part as a roundtable for impartial debate. Ultimately, it aims to set an open professional, pedagogical and analytical agenda for this growing phenomenon in universities around the world, particularly as researchers assume a leading role in shaping these programs on campus.

How Journalists React to Populism,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,24-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,CC G CENTRAL C (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:250|400-word Panel Rationale:The rise of rightwing populist politics around the world has put journalists in a difficult place. While journalists experience pushback from political actors in nearly all media systems, the populist critique goes further in its efforts to delegitimatize journalistic actors and news discourses as working against the interest of the people. Journalists are not only discounted, but often cast as enemies in a larger political struggle. This positioning pushes journalism into the spotlight as a political actor itself, which forces journalists to react. The papers on this panel examine how journalists respond to populist politics, largely through two overlapping approaches. First, journalists have to calibrate what everyday news practices should look like to confront new political realities. Accepted practices suddenly become problematic, forcing journalists to rethink, often quite publicly, what their role ought to be and how they ought to do their work. Second, journalists actively engage in public discourse about journalism and their societal role. This advocacy about journalism puts journalists in the difficult role of defending their practices in contradiction to the criticism heaped upon them by populist politicians. The papers on this panel provide insight into how journalists respond to this political climate in a diverse array of settings. In the first paper, Henrik Bødker pushes past the emphasis on contemporary politics and blame placed on digital media by looking at a historical case of journalists having to confront a large populist party that challenged journalists’ expectations of what democratic governance looks like. In the second paper, Tine Ustad Figenschou and Karoline Andrea Ihlebæk turn to what the incursion of populist rhetoric means for press criticism generally, and how journalists are forced to confront their own practices rather than ignore populist critiques. In the third paper, Melanie Bunce, Martin Scott, and Mary Myers, examine a more active campaign by journalists to advocate for press freedom in the face of populist politics as journalists work to mitigate threats that stymie their ability to work. The final paper, by Matt Carlson, interrogates how populist politics is not only a type of performance for politicians, but also one for journalists seeking to bolster their legitimacy in how they react publicly to denounce attacks on their work. Taken together, these papers illuminate how populist politics upends assumptions about journalism and provokes moments of questioning about what journalists should do and how they should respond. |Co-Sponsorship:Political Communication|Additional Information:Place this panel immediately before the Journalism Studies business meeting (which is held at 5 p.m. Sunday).

The final paper, by Matt Carlson, interrogates how populist politics is not only a type of performance for politicians, but also one for journalists seeking to bolster their legitimacy in how they react publicly to denounce attacks on their work. Taken together, these papers illuminate how populist politics upends assumptions about journalism and provokes moments of questioning about what journalists should do and how they should respond. |Co-Sponsorship:Political Communication|Additional Information:Place this panel immediately before the Journalism Studies business meeting (which is held at 5 p.m. Sunday).

How Journalists React to Populism,Panel Session,Journalism Studies,24-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,CC G CENTRAL C (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:250|400-word Panel Rationale:The rise of rightwing populist politics around the world has put journalists in a difficult place. While journalists experience pushback from political actors in nearly all media systems, the populist critique goes further in its efforts to delegitimatize journalistic actors and news discourses as working against the interest of the people. Journalists are not only discounted, but often cast as enemies in a larger political struggle. This positioning pushes journalism into the spotlight as a political actor itself, which forces journalists to react. The papers on this panel examine how journalists respond to populist politics, largely through two overlapping approaches. First, journalists have to calibrate what everyday news practices should look like to confront new political realities. Accepted practices suddenly become problematic, forcing journalists to rethink, often quite publicly, what their role ought to be and how they ought to do their work. Second, journalists actively engage in public discourse about journalism and their societal role. This advocacy about journalism puts journalists in the difficult role of defending their practices in contradiction to the criticism heaped upon them by populist politicians. The papers on this panel provide insight into how journalists respond to this political climate in a diverse array of settings. In the first paper, Henrik Bødker pushes past the emphasis on contemporary politics and blame placed on digital media by looking at a historical case of journalists having to confront a large populist party that challenged journalists’ expectations of what democratic governance looks like.

Yet, the methodological challenges posed by digital news-consumption data are manifold, yielding a wide variety of results and interpretations. This panel offers a sophisticated comparison of methodological approaches by providing different scholars with one and the same data along one and the same research question. Specifically, we ask how fragmented news use within social networking sites is. Fragmentation can be defined as the process of increasingly isolated news use as a result of the transformation from low-choice to high-choice media environments (Mancini, 2013; Napoli, 2010; van Aelst et al., 2017). As such, fragmentation can describe processes toward segmented audiences (Fletcher & Nielsen, 2017), news-outlet divergence (Prior, 2013), niches of topics (Stroud, 2010), and the like. We thus look at fragmentation from different angles, including audiences, outlets, topics, relations, and developments over time. Importantly, our panel is based on our unique useNEWS dataset, provided equally to all participants. We have combined it from three sources. First, we built on original survey data from the latest Reuters Digital News Report (Newman et al., 2019), from which we extracted all online news outlets used by at least 10 percent of respondents for each of 12 countries (i.e, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the US); this selection subsumes 9 languages, a broad variety of global regions and media systems. Second, we collected approximately one million news articles published by the same news outlets between August 2018 and August 2019 from MediaCloud, an open-source platform for media analysis jointly provided by the MIT and Harvard University. Data includes the publication date, author, and topical keywords as well as the articles’ textual content as document term matrices. Third, for each individual article URL, we collected an array of SNS engagement metrics from CrowdTangle, a subsidiary of Facebook providing aggregate numerical data on the URL including Facebook reactions (Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry), the number of shares, and comments. All presenters will adapt their own methodological approach to answer the shared research question. After presenting (1) automated content analyses, (2) multilingual document clustering, (3) time-series analyses, (4) social network analyses, and (5) agent-based modeling on the very same data, the panel will close with a discussion on the approaches’ merits and challenges.|Co-Sponsorship:Computational Methods|Additional Information:panel will likely attract Journalism scholars; ideally (if possible) do not schedule parallel to their business meeting","Chairs: Mario Haim, U of Leipzig;Chairs: Cornelius Puschmann, U of Bremen",Automated Content Analysis,3:30 PM,3:30 PM,C.

Emerging Trends in Public Diplomacy: An Early Career Perspective,Innovative Format,Public Diplomacy,25-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"Extended Abstract:The aim of this panel is to reflect emerging trends in public diplomacy from the perspective of postgraduate students and early career scholars. The status of public diplomacy as an academic field in its own right is still contested. While the current academic interest in public diplomacy is demonstrated by the growing volume of research conducted in this area, discussions about its boundaries (Gregory 2015) and appropriate theoretical and methodological approaches are still unfolding. Fitzpatrick (2010, 89) notes that there are more than 150 definitions of public diplomacy, each of which encompasses and emphasises different perspectives and approaches. This is a reflection of the often patchy theoretical underpinnings of public diplomacy in the context of a practice that moves rapidly with rapidly changing technology. In particular, mobile and social media technology use has altered and complicated conceptual boundaries that once defined diplomacy. “Digital diplomacy” is now emerging in the literature as the term that aims to embrace such technological changes in diplomacy. Ten years ago, Gregory (2008) recognised the “sunrise of an academic field” in public diplomacy. Recognition has been granted to the field in the acceptance of public diplomacy as an interest group by the International Communication Association. The emergence of the term ‘soft power’ has contributed to a reinvigoration of the debate about the role of communication in diplomacy. Coined by Joseph Nye in 1990, soft power is “the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments” (Nye 2004). The term was widely adopted in policy making, international affairs and academia after the Cold War and has moved well beyond the study of American foreign policy, emerging as a widely used conceptual framework for the analysis of general national power strategies and resources. The rise of both public diplomacy and soft power in the last two decades has reinvigorated academic debate about the role of diplomats, while introducing new definitions and frameworks that make claims about the essential dimensions and features of diplomacy. This panel aims to contribute to the debate by reflecting what early career researchers recognise as the most important sites, methods and trends and challanges for public diplomacy scholarship in the current moment. |Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Luigi Di Martino, U of Western Sydney",Chinese Soft Power and the United Nations: Intended and Received Frames About Peace Keeping Messaging From 2001 to 2018,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,R.

Ten years ago, Gregory (2008) recognised the “sunrise of an academic field” in public diplomacy. Recognition has been granted to the field in the acceptance of public diplomacy as an interest group by the International Communication Association. The emergence of the term ‘soft power’ has contributed to a reinvigoration of the debate about the role of communication in diplomacy. Coined by Joseph Nye in 1990, soft power is “the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments” (Nye 2004). The term was widely adopted in policy making, international affairs and academia after the Cold War and has moved well beyond the study of American foreign policy, emerging as a widely used conceptual framework for the analysis of general national power strategies and resources. The rise of both public diplomacy and soft power in the last two decades has reinvigorated academic debate about the role of diplomats, while introducing new definitions and frameworks that make claims about the essential dimensions and features of diplomacy. This panel aims to contribute to the debate by reflecting what early career researchers recognise as the most important sites, methods and trends and challanges for public diplomacy scholarship in the current moment. |Expected Attendance:50|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Luigi Di Martino, U of Western Sydney",Listen Up!: Data Analyses of Digital Diplomacy,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,D.

Emerging Trends in Public Diplomacy: An Early Career Perspective,Innovative Format,Public Diplomacy,25-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"Extended Abstract:The aim of this panel is to reflect emerging trends in public diplomacy from the perspective of postgraduate students and early career scholars. The status of public diplomacy as an academic field in its own right is still contested. While the current academic interest in public diplomacy is demonstrated by the growing volume of research conducted in this area, discussions about its boundaries (Gregory 2015) and appropriate theoretical and methodological approaches are still unfolding. Fitzpatrick (2010, 89) notes that there are more than 150 definitions of public diplomacy, each of which encompasses and emphasises different perspectives and approaches. This is a reflection of the often patchy theoretical underpinnings of public diplomacy in the context of a practice that moves rapidly with rapidly changing technology. In particular, mobile and social media technology use has altered and complicated conceptual boundaries that once defined diplomacy. “Digital diplomacy” is now emerging in the literature as the term that aims to embrace such technological changes in diplomacy. Ten years ago, Gregory (2008) recognised the “sunrise of an academic field” in public diplomacy. Recognition has been granted to the field in the acceptance of public diplomacy as an interest group by the International Communication Association. The emergence of the term ‘soft power’ has contributed to a reinvigoration of the debate about the role of communication in diplomacy.

With most war-related events and our knowledge about them being mediated, media and communication studies are well positioned to address the higher-order structural changes in which narratives, genres, and logics of digitally mediated activism serve to justify involvement in military campaigns or resistance toward them. The interactive construction and co-constitution of social reality has accelerated technological interdependence between social actors through different types of media. This, in turn, has led to military conflicts being encapsulated in digitally mediated, hybrid environments. The immediacy with which (dis)information can be amplified and diffused, the sheer scale at which this is possible to accomplish in the digital age, and the very low costs associated with reaching broad and diverse audiences offer unprecedented affordances for civic engagement in hybrid conflicts and concurring electoral campaigns. Narratives are central to the construction of collective identities and facilitation of social actions in moments of crisis. Ukraine has been at the epicentre of international news due to an ongoing military conflict in the country’s east, a landslide victory of former showman Volodymyr Zelensky, and, more recently, a diplomatic faux pas involving the U.S. President Donald Trump. Yet, the top-level mass-mediated narratives do little to shed light on the large-scale networked activism happening in the backdrop of these processes. This panel brings together a diverse team of scholars of digital activism to foreground the frames, narratives and logics of collective mobilization in this hybrid environment. Situating our inquiry in contemporary Ukraine, we investigate the cultural, symbolic, and political significance of narratives, which serve to mobilize domestic and international actors within, as well as outside, the conflict. Panel papers explore the narratives that a variety of different groups involved in the Ukranian conflict construct, including civic activists, activist hacker collectives, domestic and foreign state actors, as well as populist political actors. We examine both the personal and the public narratives that these different groups utilize to make sense of their activism and its outcomes. Overall, the panel provides a deep understanding of the social and cultural dynamics that help mobilize the networked publics and guide the actions of a variety of different actors. It also offers an analytical lens for understanding roles of activist communities and publics in hybrid geopolitical events. |Co-Sponsorship:Communication and the Technology|Additional Information:","Chairs: Brian McKernan, Syracuse U",Hacking for Resistance: Frames and Narratives of Hacking in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,T.

Yet, the top-level mass-mediated narratives do little to shed light on the large-scale networked activism happening in the backdrop of these processes. This panel brings together a diverse team of scholars of digital activism to foreground the frames, narratives and logics of collective mobilization in this hybrid environment. Situating our inquiry in contemporary Ukraine, we investigate the cultural, symbolic, and political significance of narratives, which serve to mobilize domestic and international actors within, as well as outside, the conflict. Panel papers explore the narratives that a variety of different groups involved in the Ukranian conflict construct, including civic activists, activist hacker collectives, domestic and foreign state actors, as well as populist political actors. We examine both the personal and the public narratives that these different groups utilize to make sense of their activism and its outcomes. Overall, the panel provides a deep understanding of the social and cultural dynamics that help mobilize the networked publics and guide the actions of a variety of different actors. It also offers an analytical lens for understanding roles of activist communities and publics in hybrid geopolitical events. |Co-Sponsorship:Communication and the Technology|Additional Information:","Chairs: Brian McKernan, Syracuse U",“Those Who Craft the Victory”: Narrating Geopolitics Within the Mundane,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,O.

With most war-related events and our knowledge about them being mediated, media and communication studies are well positioned to address the higher-order structural changes in which narratives, genres, and logics of digitally mediated activism serve to justify involvement in military campaigns or resistance toward them. The interactive construction and co-constitution of social reality has accelerated technological interdependence between social actors through different types of media. This, in turn, has led to military conflicts being encapsulated in digitally mediated, hybrid environments. The immediacy with which (dis)information can be amplified and diffused, the sheer scale at which this is possible to accomplish in the digital age, and the very low costs associated with reaching broad and diverse audiences offer unprecedented affordances for civic engagement in hybrid conflicts and concurring electoral campaigns.

Regionalization Matters: Chinese-Korean Integration in Global Media Industries,Panel Session,Media Industry Studies,25-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The trans-border transactions of media products, finances, and practitioners between Mainland China and South Korea have intensified over the past two decades. As a result, Chinese and Korean media industries have experienced increased interdependence and advanced integration. For example, in the early 2010s, Chinese satellite television channels and film production companies took the initiative to collaborate with Korean media practitioners. Such a collaboration not only allowed Korean broadcasting and film industries to secure financial revenues, but also forced them to consider Chinese cultural values in the production process. When the Chinese government banned Korean entertainment content in late 2016 in order to cultivate its own national popular culture and practice, Korean media industries experienced a significant financial crisis. As a result, these Korean media industries managed the situation by finding alternative markets. This panel pays particular attention to the dynamics that Chinese and Korean media industries have generated during the past decades, with the view that this regional entity is an excellent context to reveal the regional dimension of media globalization. Regionalization, referring to the structure and process of micro-level interactions involving regional powers, has tremendously transformed the contemporary international system (Dent, 2016). Indeed, what has deepened East Asia’s interdependence on the economic, political, security, socio-cultural spheres? How do their diplomatic and political conditions generate numerous types of dynamics and tensions in the media industries? This panel not only delves into the new challenges and possibilities emerging within Sino-Korean collaborations, but also situates the East Asian model in the context of neoliberal globalization. Four panelists from Australia, Korea, China, and the United States will discuss the political, economic, and socio-cultural aspects of Chinese-Korean media integration in national, transnational, intra-regional, and global contexts. Kai Ruo Soh seeks to assess the importance of localized film content for Chinese audiences, canvassing a range of hitherto unknown opinions regarding ‘Korean’ and ‘Chinese’ styles of storytelling. Wenna Zeng analyzes the power relations among Korean producers (who bring cultural influences and professionalism), commercial parties represented by Internet companies, and the government, to explore the subtle and complex relationships in Chinese TV production. Ju Oak Kim’s paper examines how political and diplomatic relations have engaged in Sino-Korean connections, and how the Chinese government’s ban on Korean pop music has shifted Korean music agencies’ focus from China to the Western world. Sojeong Park’s ethnographic study brings the beauty industry to the fore of discussions in media integration. In-depth interviews with make-up artists and YouTubers who have worked with Chinese media companies provide insights on the expansion of industrial integration to the beauty industries. This panel brings regional integration to the fore of discussions on global media systems and industries, embracing the issues of digital media, political and diplomatic relations, aesthetics and receptions, governmental regulations, and cultural and linguistic (un)translatability. Rationale The study of media industries has engaged with a wider array of US/UK-based media texts, markets, production cultures, technologies, regulations, and policies. Although such societies have certainly played key roles in the global media industries, these western-centered perspectives and discussions remain as other salient parts of global media culture and practice as a relatively untouched area in academic scholarship. Against this backdrop, the panel provides an Asian context to enrich the discussion regarding the proliferation of regional and transnational collaborations in the global media industries.

Women and the Digital: Struggles for Empowerment and the Exhausting Endurance of Gender Discrimination,Panel Session,Feminist Scholarship,25-May-2020,8:00 AM,9:15 AM,Star Southport 1 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Feminist scholars have long challenged the often myopic focus of government, corporate entities, media, and some scholarship on the unquestioned positive benefits of technology usage. As a range of information communication technologies (ICTs) have diffused globally, questions continue to emerge around whether and how such technologies can empower women, particularly those that are marginalized by cultural, social, and/or economic forces. This panel interrogates how technological practices in diverse contexts in the Global South are cross-cut by gendered, classed, placed, and raced identities, which are situated within multiple structures and power relations. We view technology not as “tool” but rather as an assemblage of material objects, discursive practices, emotional and financial investments, and human and non-human actors. In our analyses, we avoid an empowerment/disempowerment binary but instead draw upon Kabeer’s (2001) understanding of empowerment as a process of broadening people’s ability to make choices and act upon them, while highlighting the structural limitations that inhibit such processes, particularly for women. The panelists employ a range of qualitative methods, including interviews, participant observation, discourse analysis, ethnography, and virtual ethnography, in diverse sites – factories, rural villages, tech incubators – to critically analyze the complicated and sometimes contradictory manner in which technology is articulated to modes of empowerment. Oreglia reveals how differing cultural values and understandings of privacy on the part of (usually western male) tech designers are at odds with the particular needs and circumstances of female factory workers trying to access family planning information in Cambodia. Komen finds that middle-class, peri-urban Kenyan women who feel empowered by their mobile internet access lack the digital literacy skills necessary to make informed decisions regarding the health-related information they seek. Wallis shows how middle-aged rural Chinese women’s efforts at e-commerce are often stymied by patriarchal forces at the macro-level, including limited access to technological resources, and the micro-level via familial relationships that subordinate their business efforts to men’s. Lindtner unpacks how the promise of technological intervention and hacktivism normalizes the exploitation of Chinese happiness workers – young and highly educated women who work for low pay in a range of new organizational models from incubators to fablabs. From a critical feminist perspective and through nuanced analyses, the panelists bring to light how engagement with technology can reconfigure and reproduce gendered, classed, placed, and raced power dynamics. The findings contribute theoretical insights into the constitutive nature of gender, technology, and empowerment and the implications for social change. |Co-Sponsorship:Global Communication and Social Change|Additional Information:","Participant: Leah Komen, Daystar U;Participant: Silvia Lindtner, University of Michigan;Discussant: Mirca Madianou, Goldsmiths, U of London;Participant: Elisa Oregllia, Kings College London;Chairs: Cara Wallis, Texas A&M U;Participant: Cara Wallis, Texas A&M U",The Gendered Digital Divide in Cambodia: A Wicked Problem?,8:00 AM,8:00 AM,E.

However, the way streaming has been taken up, and how the concept of streaming is understood, is extremely variable across different countries, industries and genres. In the context of the media industries, streaming refers at the most basic technical level merely to playing music or video from the internet, but it is tied up with shifts from payment for physical products to subscription models, and with the so-called ‘platformisation of cultural production’ (as discussed in recent and forthcoming special issues of Social Media and Society), and with the entry of giant technology firms into cultural markets – though discussion of that entry is sometimes excessively confined to the US GAFA oligopoly. There have been very few efforts to focus on international similarities and differences in the dynamics of change unleashed by streaming. This panel brings together case studies of streaming in order to enhance understanding of such international variability, and to ask in what ways and to what extent streaming altering or maintaining the dynamics of media industries. We focus here on film, television and music, but also address the phenomenon of ‘live streaming’, which cuts across genres and media forms. The first two papers focus on video, the next two on music. The panel begins with Smith Mehta’s analysis of how the global subscription video streaming giants Prime and Netflix are reshaping Bollywood. Elaine Jing Zhao then considers how an important feature of streaming services, their display of metrics, is affecting the development of streaming platforms in China, including the rise of new intermediaries. Turning to music, David Hesmondhalgh assesses various international controversies concerning music streaming platforms and the way in which revenue is or is not distributed to musicians. Qu Shuwen analyses the rise of live streaming in China, in the context of music, showing how one particular giant is shaping a new musical eco-system in that country. Respondent Patrik Wikstrom will reflect on what these papers contribute to our understanding of international variations of dynamics of change and continuity in the media industries. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: David Hesmondhalgh, U of Leeds;Discussant: Patrik Wikstrom, Queensland U of Technology;Chairs: Patrik Wikstrom, Queensland U of Technology",Are Amazon Prime and Netflix the 'New' Bollywood?,9:30 AM,9:30 AM,S.

Open Science meets Digital Methods - Match Made in Heaven or Mutually Exclusive?,Panel Session,Theme,25-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,Star Southport 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Increasingly, the calls for open communication science are being echoed throughout the field. At the same time, the field is experiencing dramatic methodological growth. New digital communication research methods, such as the use of tracking data or high frequency measurements, are rapidly emerging in a media environment that is increasingly shaped by algorithms and personalized communication. But where is the overlap? This panel aims to discover how an open science perspective can be applied to these innovative, digital methods as well as identify the barriers that emerge in such “open methods”. The panel will highlight an open science approach to data collection, method, and model development. Issues of user privacy and identifiability - including adherence to GDPR - will be connected to the four pillars of open science: pre-registration, sharing data, sharing analysis materials, and sharing trained models. With this proposal, we seek to substantially advance open science practices in communication research that employs digital methods. First, the presentations in this panel address this question from multiple methodological standpoints, such as the use of browser plug-ins for digital trace data, (mobile) data donations, and API access provided by tech-companies. Second, the theme uniting the papers is the search for best practices when it comes to increasing transparency in the methods that are used for studying digital media. Each presentation will discuss the scholar’s specific research initiative, (early) results, and the lessons they have learned thus far - both in terms of recommendations and pitfalls to avoid - as to how we can sufficiently and soundly apply open science to digital communication methods. Lastly, by bringing together scholars from Asia, Europe, and the U.S., the panel highlights the importance and challenges of open science from different regulatory backgrounds, thereby stressing the importance of internationally applicable open science standards. |Co-Sponsorship:Theme|Additional Information:","Chairs: Theo Araujo, U of Amsterdam;Chairs: Claes de Vreese, U of Amsterdam;Discussant: Benjamin Johnson, U of Florida;Chairs: Jakob Ohme, U of Amsterdam;Chairs: Jessica Piotrowski, U of Amsterdam/ASCoR","Open Science vs. Privacy?

Social Credit Systems: China and Beyond,Panel Session,Communication and Technology,25-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,CC G ARENA 1B (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:China’s most ambitious digital governance project – the Social Credit System (SCS) – has been the subject of intense international scrutiny for its dystopian surveillance potentials. The Chinese government intends to implement the SCS nationwide by 2020 to evaluate the trustworthiness of individuals, companies and state agencies in China with mechanisms of rewards and punishments. Several aspects currently complicate the study of the SCS. First, many journalistic stories and scholarly studies (e.g. Botsman, 2017) do not differentiate the SCS as a national framework and its various local experimentations, thus unable to generalize how the SCS is experienced locally. Second, popular press and academic studies (e.g. Arora, 2019) do not tend to distinguish the governmental SCS from its commercial counterpart Sesame Credit, the latter a ratings system developed by Chinese Internet giant Alibaba to rate users mostly on their financial creditworthiness but has also come to include some social metrics. Third, while the SCS is seen as an invention of the digital age, the idea of social credits, or the performance of a “credible” self for “economies of obligations” (Muldrew, 1998), is endemic to many societies prior. Fourth, although a government-led large-scale SCS is seen as exceptionally Chinese, many other societies from Japan to the US have witnessed programs similar to Alibaba’s Sesame Credit emerge. This discussion panel on social credits raises the level of conversations and debates about social ratings systems both inside China and beyond, both historically and contemporarily. Jun Liu examines how China’s SCS compares to credit scoring systems in Western societies, both types depending heavily on big data and AI. He argues that we need to contextualize China’s SCS in its Leviathan-style traditions. Min Jiang takes a historical perspective to trace the antecedents of the SCS in China, from the personnel records system in imperial China, to Dang’an system (or personnel dossiers) used by the Chinese Communist Party, to more recent debate surrounding “morality files” to deepen our understanding of the historical lineage of the SCS. Jing Wang examines the SCS based on a case study of “Constructing Credit Shanghai,” a government-led project. She investigates how credit-scoring metrics have extended from financial sectors to social governance with the emergence of “credit authority”. Fan Liang studies the automation of citizen classification through the personal credit scoring platforms in 25 Chinese cities and finds such platforms enable the automated classification and scrutiny of citizens on a continuous and real-time basis.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Min Jiang, UNC Charlotte;Participant: Fan Liang, U of Michigan;Participant: Jun Liu, U of Copenhagen;Participant: Jing Wang, NYU Shanghai","Unique, but Not Exceptional: The ""Myth"" of China's Social Credit System",9:30 AM,9:30 AM,J.

Jun Liu examines how China’s SCS compares to credit scoring systems in Western societies, both types depending heavily on big data and AI. He argues that we need to contextualize China’s SCS in its Leviathan-style traditions. Min Jiang takes a historical perspective to trace the antecedents of the SCS in China, from the personnel records system in imperial China, to Dang’an system (or personnel dossiers) used by the Chinese Communist Party, to more recent debate surrounding “morality files” to deepen our understanding of the historical lineage of the SCS. Jing Wang examines the SCS based on a case study of “Constructing Credit Shanghai,” a government-led project. She investigates how credit-scoring metrics have extended from financial sectors to social governance with the emergence of “credit authority”. Fan Liang studies the automation of citizen classification through the personal credit scoring platforms in 25 Chinese cities and finds such platforms enable the automated classification and scrutiny of citizens on a continuous and real-time basis.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Min Jiang, UNC Charlotte;Participant: Fan Liang, U of Michigan;Participant: Jun Liu, U of Copenhagen;Participant: Jing Wang, NYU Shanghai","Jiaku, Dang’An and Morality Files: Antecedents to the Social Credit System in China",9:30 AM,9:30 AM,M.

Social Credit Systems: China and Beyond,Panel Session,Communication and Technology,25-May-2020,9:30 AM,10:45 AM,CC G ARENA 1B (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:China’s most ambitious digital governance project – the Social Credit System (SCS) – has been the subject of intense international scrutiny for its dystopian surveillance potentials. The Chinese government intends to implement the SCS nationwide by 2020 to evaluate the trustworthiness of individuals, companies and state agencies in China with mechanisms of rewards and punishments. Several aspects currently complicate the study of the SCS. First, many journalistic stories and scholarly studies (e.g. Botsman, 2017) do not differentiate the SCS as a national framework and its various local experimentations, thus unable to generalize how the SCS is experienced locally. Second, popular press and academic studies (e.g. Arora, 2019) do not tend to distinguish the governmental SCS from its commercial counterpart Sesame Credit, the latter a ratings system developed by Chinese Internet giant Alibaba to rate users mostly on their financial creditworthiness but has also come to include some social metrics. Third, while the SCS is seen as an invention of the digital age, the idea of social credits, or the performance of a “credible” self for “economies of obligations” (Muldrew, 1998), is endemic to many societies prior.

Declarations of Independence: Evaluating Independence Across Media Industries,Panel Session,Media Industry Studies,25-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:The concept of “independence” is both a discourse and description of ownership structure in many media industries. Despite the common use of this term, however, little empirical examination of the concept exists outside of studies of specific media, particularly cinema and music. Further, scholarship examines “independence” as a discursive category more commonly than as a set of industrial characteristics. This panel brings together an international group of experts to examine the role of “independence” in particular industries – comic books, video games, cinema, and television – with the aim of contributing to a greater understanding of independence within media industries more broadly. Can “independence” by theorized across media industry studies? Is “independence” more than a discursive marker in popular culture, but also entails specific business practices? Alternatively, how does the discursive power of the category “independent” inform the behaviors of companies or entire industries? What do the similarities and differences among independent firms in different media tell us about media industries in general? Such questions are especially crucial in the context of corporate consolidation in the media. Greg Steirer begins with an examination of independent comic book publishers, Looking particularly at how Image Comics has shaped the characteristics of independence in the comics business. Rae Moors follows with an analysis of how ""strategic independence"" developed in the video games industry in response to the business practices of Triple A and 1st Party console-making companies in the 1990s, when companies like Nintendo and Microsoft attempted to control and set standards for game production in general. Daniel Herbert looks at New Line Cinema and Netflix as two distinct cases that suggest how the innovations of independent distributors can serve the larger movie industry in different historical moments. Amanda Lotz closes the panel with a consideration of independent television, looking particularly at British policy interventions aimed at expanding independent television and questioning their effectivity. Together, the papers on this panel assess the significance of “independence” as a category that shapes the practices in multiple media industries and, further, represent the potential for cross-media industry analysis. |Co-Sponsorship:Popular Communication|Additional Information:","Chairs: Daniel Herbert, U of Michigan",Independent From What?: Image Comics and the Normalization of Independence in the Comic Book Industry,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,G.

Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Technology-Driven Events,Panel Session,Communication and Technology,25-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,CC G ARENA 1A (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Terrorist attacks, natural disasters, protests, incidents, and accidents are now represented by a myriad of actors on social and digital media platforms, often within seconds of a bomb going off, a shot being fired, a drone attacking, an earthquake hitting. Technologies (continue to) play a significant role in media events – from platforms that shape how events are narrated through their design, policies, and user cultures, to AI technologies that predict future events. An event’s constitution through reports, eyewitness accounts, and explanations on social media pave the way for societal action. These events differ in significant ways from the ceremonial, planned and univocal “media events” that Dyan and Katz wrote about in their pathbreaking book of 1992. Although much work has been done to extend Dyan and Katz’s reading of media events to engage with the globalized, multiplatform nature of the current communication environment (e.g. Couldry, Hepp and Krotz eds, 2010), there are still significant gaps in understanding how specific technologies influence the flow and trajectory of events. Studying events is a challenge. We cannot easily track an event by following its contours across time and space because its meaning lies on constantly shifting ground. An unexpected event might be characterised differently as it unfolds and is negotiated by different actors – from “accident” to “incident” to “terrorist attack” in the case of September 11, for example (Wagner-Pacifici, 2010). But it is the power of this unwieldy process of meaning-making that is so important to address when events become a virtual battlefield amongst different social and political agents who compete for control of history. At the same time, socio-technical assemblages shape how knowledge about events is created and shared, from algorithms to platforms process to drone infrastructures. How do different disciplines conceptualise events and develop methodologies to address these issues? This panel presents a range of solutions to the conceptual and methodological challenges of studying events from the fields of Science and Technology Studies, political communications, cultural studies, and media studies. Applying a range of cases, we conceptualise the role of technologies in the events that punctuate daily life today. From drones to wikis to social media platforms and algorithms, our ultimate goal is to understand how the material and symbolic come together to constitute our understandings of the events that shake our understanding of what happens, why it happens, and what should happen as a result. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Discussant: Axel Bruns, Queensland U of Technology;Chairs: Heather Ford, U of Technology Sydney",The Role of Digital Technology in Populist Disruptive Performance,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,L.

Technologies (continue to) play a significant role in media events – from platforms that shape how events are narrated through their design, policies, and user cultures, to AI technologies that predict future events. An event’s constitution through reports, eyewitness accounts, and explanations on social media pave the way for societal action. These events differ in significant ways from the ceremonial, planned and univocal “media events” that Dyan and Katz wrote about in their pathbreaking book of 1992. Although much work has been done to extend Dyan and Katz’s reading of media events to engage with the globalized, multiplatform nature of the current communication environment (e.g. Couldry, Hepp and Krotz eds, 2010), there are still significant gaps in understanding how specific technologies influence the flow and trajectory of events. Studying events is a challenge. We cannot easily track an event by following its contours across time and space because its meaning lies on constantly shifting ground. An unexpected event might be characterised differently as it unfolds and is negotiated by different actors – from “accident” to “incident” to “terrorist attack” in the case of September 11, for example (Wagner-Pacifici, 2010). But it is the power of this unwieldy process of meaning-making that is so important to address when events become a virtual battlefield amongst different social and political agents who compete for control of history. At the same time, socio-technical assemblages shape how knowledge about events is created and shared, from algorithms to platforms process to drone infrastructures. How do different disciplines conceptualise events and develop methodologies to address these issues?

Open science is largely framed in terms of benefits for scholars advancing research with less consideration for individual participants, whose risks may be increased significantly. Although we agree that transparency and creation of public goods are noble goals, members of this panel will consider what transparency may mean when studying Communication with more marginalized groups (e.g., minors, low socio-economic status, LGBTQ+) or with entities that wish to harm researchers themselves. Panelists advocate for more contextualization and consideration for unanticipated consequences in open science practices. Panelists will briefly present (4-6 minutes each) on their perspectives as researchers working in their areas. Panelists will present on their own experiences with increased transparency within their research. For example, Pearce will discuss authoritarian regime surveillance of researchers and her efforts to decrease transparency for safety reasons. Trevisan will consider approaches to protect marginalized participants to ensure ethical research and simultaneously create richer and more valid datasets in sensitive areas such as disability. And Vitak will share her experiences partnering with librarians to act as intermediaries with poor community members and build trust and rapport before and during data collection. The panel will conclude with panelists discussing paths forward whereby open science principles can be wedded with better research practices geared toward marginalized groups and researchers themselves. Key takeaways include: promoting continual research and discussions on what makes data identifiable, updating guidelines, and making sure journals are abiding by guidelines; controlled access, tracking, and agreements for use rather than putting everything out in the open for anyone to access; and systematically understand university open access policies/cultures as well as perspectives/ experiences of a) vulnerable researchers; and/or b) marginalized populations in relation to open science/open access.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Jesse Fox, The Ohio State U;Participant: Adrienne Massanari, U of Illinois at Chicago;Participant: Katy Pearce, U of Washington;Participant: Cheryll Soriano, De La Salle University;Participant: Lukasz Szulc, U of Sheffiled;Participant: Filippo Trevisan, American U;Participant: Jessica Vitak, U of Maryland",Open Science and Additional Concerns When Working With Marginalized Populations Panelist 1,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,A.

Open Science and Additional Concerns When Working With Marginalized Populations,Panel Session,Theme,25-May-2020,11:00 AM,12:15 PM,Star Southport 2 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:In response to the conference theme of “Open Science,” a panel of Communication scholars reflect upon their concerns about how open science practices may affect the study of marginalized populations. Open science is largely framed in terms of benefits for scholars advancing research with less consideration for individual participants, whose risks may be increased significantly. Although we agree that transparency and creation of public goods are noble goals, members of this panel will consider what transparency may mean when studying Communication with more marginalized groups (e.g., minors, low socio-economic status, LGBTQ+) or with entities that wish to harm researchers themselves. Panelists advocate for more contextualization and consideration for unanticipated consequences in open science practices. Panelists will briefly present (4-6 minutes each) on their perspectives as researchers working in their areas. Panelists will present on their own experiences with increased transparency within their research. For example, Pearce will discuss authoritarian regime surveillance of researchers and her efforts to decrease transparency for safety reasons. Trevisan will consider approaches to protect marginalized participants to ensure ethical research and simultaneously create richer and more valid datasets in sensitive areas such as disability. And Vitak will share her experiences partnering with librarians to act as intermediaries with poor community members and build trust and rapport before and during data collection. The panel will conclude with panelists discussing paths forward whereby open science principles can be wedded with better research practices geared toward marginalized groups and researchers themselves. Key takeaways include: promoting continual research and discussions on what makes data identifiable, updating guidelines, and making sure journals are abiding by guidelines; controlled access, tracking, and agreements for use rather than putting everything out in the open for anyone to access; and systematically understand university open access policies/cultures as well as perspectives/ experiences of a) vulnerable researchers; and/or b) marginalized populations in relation to open science/open access.|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Jesse Fox, The Ohio State U;Participant: Adrienne Massanari, U of Illinois at Chicago;Participant: Katy Pearce, U of Washington;Participant: Cheryll Soriano, De La Salle University;Participant: Lukasz Szulc, U of Sheffiled;Participant: Filippo Trevisan, American U;Participant: Jessica Vitak, U of Maryland",Open Science and Additional Concerns When Working With Marginalized Populations Panelist 7,11:00 AM,11:00 AM,F.

However, to date, most research on queer digital culture continues to focus on English-based platforms popular among Western user groups. Therefore, this panel contributes to the existing scholarship through examining the diverse manifestations of queer digital cultures in Asia Pacific regions, including China, South Korea, and Australia. As non-Western dating applications (e.g., Blued and Rela) and non-Western social media (e.g., TikTok and Douban) are growing in global prominence while Western, English-based platforms continue dominating some markets, researchers in this panel investigate the use of different platforms that are prominent among the communities they are working with. This panel, as a whole, asks the following questions: What kinds of politics are enabled by/in the emerging queer digital culture in Asia Pacific? What are the opportunities and challenges that queer digital culture presents to people of different gender and sexual identities? What are the relationships between queer digital media and queer space, in the context of different regions where acceptance toward same-sex desire and practice varies? What consideration should researchers take in researching queer digital culture in cities where homosexuality still carries stigma? The five papers in this panel together address three intersecting vectors. The first is inter-platform networking and online-offline connection. It is acknowledged in this panel that isolating digital communication on a single platform often presents limitations in theorizing queer digital culture and capturing communicative activities among queer communities. People use more than one platform (Cassidy & Wang, 2018) for more than one use (Timmermans & De Caluwé, 2017) and regard each platform as part of an organic whole in their navigation of queer spaces. For example, the paper on Chinese queer female diaspora in Australia shows that the cross-platform communication between WeChat and Rela, while the paper on Beijing LGBT media ecology features the convergence of virtual and physical spaces. The second vector reveals the contradictions, ambivalence, and instabilities in queer digital culture (see Chan, 2018; Fitzpatrick & Birnholtz, 2018). The paper on queer performativity in cross-dressing short videos examines the perpetuation of gender hierarchy, and the paper on gay app use in China discusses the contradictory affects users experience. The instability of queer digital culture has its roots in the fluid, versatile queer identities that are in constant negotiation and confrontation with the heteronormative hegemony. The third and final concern raised in this panel is methodological depth. Multiple papers on this panel have community-engaged elements in their methods, and the perspectives of queer communities on the ground are taken seriously. Particularly, the paper on South Korea gay cultures explores the ethical dimension of studying sexual minorities in less tolerant localities. These three vectors, while applicable to areas beyond Asia Pacific, call attention to the importance of culture-specific contexts in queer media scholarship. This panel highlights both the commonalities and particularities of queer digital culture in Asia Pacific and contributes to queer media scholarship with a transnational and comparative perspective.

BLUE SKY WORKSHOP: I Thought You Would Have the Answers: Building Effective Researcher-Practitioner Collectives,Blue Sky Workshops,Blue Sky Workshops,25-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC G CENTRAL B (GCCEC Ground),"400-word Panel Rationale:How do we effectively connect research to practice? During this professional development workshop, a team of academic researchers, public media professionals and program evaluators will share best practices for academic-practitioner research, developed through their collaborations on science communication projects. Interactive activities will invite participants to explore common concerns, learn how to identify and meet each party’s needs (such as balancing rigor and timeliness), and recognize the importance of ongoing, open communication. What is the value of an academic-practitioner research collective? For one, it fosters the principles of open science: transparency, collaboration and knowledge-sharing. When working with media practitioners, researchers learn that information is most valuable in real-time. Producers have deadlines and need to make data-driven decisions. This need pushes researchers to share preliminary findings, increasing transparency and inviting others to examine their process. Through collaboration, researchers learn to consider the types of knowledge that will help professionals create more effective media. In turn, practitioners learn to approach their work with a researcher’s mindset, to go beyond the creator’s gut instincts and consider: What do we know? How do we know it? How can we measure that? This type of knowledge-sharing and professional development expands thinking and improves practice for both researchers and practitioners. Our goals for this workshop are to invite discussion on the value of and concerns raised by this type of applied, collaborative research and to share not only what we have learned but to generate new ideas for effective collaboration. The workshop will consist of three sections: Overview: Introductions and sharing some of our learning on academic-practitioner research collaboration; Breakouts: Small groups of participants will be given scenarios and discuss how to resolve issues, meet needs and work together effectively, concluding with share outs; and Dialogue: Open discussion of some of the key issues, concerns and questions that arise with this type of research. Requirements: There are no requirements for participation. However, you are invited to bring your own questions or issues you are dealing with to discuss. You may also contact the workshop chair in advance to suggest a scenario for the breakouts. |Expected Attendance:25|Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Elizabeth Bandy, U of Mount Union;Participant: Sue Ellen McCann, KQED;Participant: Scott Burg, Rockman, et al",,,,,,,

Dyadic Health Conversations: Capturing Interactions Using Diverse Data Collection and Analysis Techniques,Panel Session,Interpersonal Communication,25-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC G ARENA 1A (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Extant research has elucidated processes by which dyads communicate about health issues to achieve goals such as eliciting social support and managing health-related uncertainty. Benefits of dyadic communication around health abound; for example, partners, parents, and friends can encourage one another to avoid risky behavior and take care of their bodies and minds. Scholars have also recognized that there are risks involved in interpersonal communication about health such as unhelpful supportive messages and failures to manage information appropriately. Discussing health topics is sensitive and has multiple potential identity implications; for example, health is connected to individuals’ sense of self, topics such as weight management and health history can be face-threatening, and the management of multiple identities may constitute a health threat itself. Despite the interactive nature of dyadic health conversations, an overwhelming amount of health-related interpersonal communication research has been conducted from the perspective of just one person, at one point in time. Because understanding the dynamics of communication with close others about health issues is critical, this panel brings together scholarship on dyadic interactions regarding health. The papers on this panel engage a variety of interpersonal communication theories including Identity Implications Theory, Theory of Motivated Information Management, and Theory of Resilience and Relational Load to examine how couples, parents and children, college students and conversation partners, and grandparents and grandchildren talk about and navigate sharing health information. In addition to attending to health issues, these conversations serve to build and maintain close interpersonal ties. The studies represented on this panel examine message features such as face threat, test the effect of how uncertainty is managed on information seeking, and explore new technology that can aid in promoting communication about disease. Interactions regarding various health challenges or topics are included (i.e., diabetes, family health history, perceived stress, sleep, and nutrition/diet and physical activity). To understand these interactions, the studies employ a range of data collection techniques and methodologies including daily diary surveys, smart phone application technology, face-to-face interactions/observation, multilevel structural equation modeling, and longitudinal and dyadic data analysis. To encourage transparency in communication science and to speak to the conference theme of “open science,” scholars on the panel will discuss the process of recruiting participants and collecting data. Data collection for such projects is a difficult, time- and resource-intensive process. Scholars will discuss techniques for securing funding for such projects and managing longitudinal dyadic data collection. |Co-Sponsorship:Health Communication|Additional Information:","Discussant: Steven Wilson, U of South Florida",Testing the Dyadic Claims of the Theory of Motivated Information Management: Married Couples' Information Seeking and Provision About Family Health History,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,K.

The studies represented on this panel examine message features such as face threat, test the effect of how uncertainty is managed on information seeking, and explore new technology that can aid in promoting communication about disease. Interactions regarding various health challenges or topics are included (i.e., diabetes, family health history, perceived stress, sleep, and nutrition/diet and physical activity). To understand these interactions, the studies employ a range of data collection techniques and methodologies including daily diary surveys, smart phone application technology, face-to-face interactions/observation, multilevel structural equation modeling, and longitudinal and dyadic data analysis. To encourage transparency in communication science and to speak to the conference theme of “open science,” scholars on the panel will discuss the process of recruiting participants and collecting data. Data collection for such projects is a difficult, time- and resource-intensive process. Scholars will discuss techniques for securing funding for such projects and managing longitudinal dyadic data collection. |Co-Sponsorship:Health Communication|Additional Information:","Discussant: Steven Wilson, U of South Florida","Dyadic Conversations About Diet and Physical Activity: Examining the Relationship Between Face-Threatening Messages, Psychological Reactance, and Health Attitudes and Behaviors",2:00 PM,2:00 PM,E.

Dyadic Health Conversations: Capturing Interactions Using Diverse Data Collection and Analysis Techniques,Panel Session,Interpersonal Communication,25-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,CC G ARENA 1A (GCCEC Ground),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Extant research has elucidated processes by which dyads communicate about health issues to achieve goals such as eliciting social support and managing health-related uncertainty. Benefits of dyadic communication around health abound; for example, partners, parents, and friends can encourage one another to avoid risky behavior and take care of their bodies and minds. Scholars have also recognized that there are risks involved in interpersonal communication about health such as unhelpful supportive messages and failures to manage information appropriately. Discussing health topics is sensitive and has multiple potential identity implications; for example, health is connected to individuals’ sense of self, topics such as weight management and health history can be face-threatening, and the management of multiple identities may constitute a health threat itself. Despite the interactive nature of dyadic health conversations, an overwhelming amount of health-related interpersonal communication research has been conducted from the perspective of just one person, at one point in time. Because understanding the dynamics of communication with close others about health issues is critical, this panel brings together scholarship on dyadic interactions regarding health.

Out in the Field: Ethnographic Approaches to Studying Sports Communication,Panel Session,Sports Communication,25-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:|400-word Panel Rationale:“Out in the Field: Ethnographic Approaches to Studying Sports Communication” explores the relationship between sports, communication and media, and ethnographic research practices. Specifically, this panel considers how mobile or multi-sited ethnographies (George Marcus, 1995), which prioritize field studies that look across a variety of spaces, are useful within sports studies. It will consider how to use ethnographies to better understand the “connections, associations, and putative relationships” that create a chain of cultural production specific to sports cultures and media. The papers on this panel follow an in situ approach that focuses on how multiple sites of sports culture and media engagements fit into the larger “mosaic of collective identity work” (Gray, 2009). Using these methodological ideas as a starting point, the papers trace the circulation of sports/media through different contexts and spaces. While exploring the situational concerns related to conducting sports communication ethnographies, these papers seek to better understand how sports culture communicates an array of meanings through the interplay of media, identity formation, and physical/geographic location. Courtney Cox interrogates issues of labor, culture, and politics through women’s basketball around the world using interviews and field observations which consider how athletes, journalists, and activists create space for themselves and others in a male-dominated sport. Cerianne Robertson uses the Olympics as a lens through which to investigate the contestation of narratives about global cities. Evan Brody uses a multi-sited field study of gay sports bars to better understand how members of the LGBT community navigate the intersection of sports affinity, queer identity, media texts, and community spaces. Lastly, Jason Kido Lopez investigates how the game of betting on sports is constructed by media in casino sports books in Las Vegas, Nevada. Collectively, the papers explore the study of sports media and cultures through ethnography. They unpack and trouble the unique situations confronted by sports communication scholars engaged in multi-sited, in situ field studies, while also providing results from current ethnographic projects which draw upon a variety of contexts and spaces in order to map current intersections of sports, communication, and media. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Evan Brody, U of Wisconsin-La Crosse",Rebounding as Praxis: Interrogating Positionality and Proximity in Ethnographic Fieldwork,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,C.

Costas and Grey (2018) argued that violence is “totally familiar yet hardly perceived in organizations” and “curiously both absent and present within organization studies” (p. 1574). We agree that violence is potentially visible|present or invisible|absent in organizations and therefore embrace their “sensibility” towards violence. Specifically, we consider the ways (organizational) violence is often hidden or unacknowledged because of its gendered nature. In associating masculinity and violence, Hearn (1996) argued that because organizations are usually formed via “structural relations of domination, control, and violence,” they may reproduce those very relations (p. 44). Indeed, Flores (2018) and Harris (2018) offer the term “violent gender” to truly explicate gendered violence. In this panel, we consider ways that structural, interpersonal, and/or intrapersonal gendered violence(s) are present in women’s organizational lives (James et al., 2003). A structural (institutional, systemic) perspective recognizes that violence need not be something done “by X to Y” but can rather be embedded in social relations (Costas & Grey, 2018). An interpersonal perspective corresponds to conventional definitions of violence between and among individuals and includes not only physical violence but also symbolic violence (James et al., 2003). Finally, intrapersonal violence is directed toward the self and includes not only self-harm but any attitude that damages the individual’s physical/psychological well-being and capacity for self-care (James et al., 2003). For example, Baines and Cunningham (2011) explored how women are socialized into the gendered violence of “white knuckle care work” in providing social services to clients amidst constant threat of physical violence and daily repetitive verbal abuse. “A variety of consent structures elicited the acquiescence of women to accept gendered violence at work”, capitalizing on their high degree of commitment to caring for clients, which is emphasized as natural for women (p. 768). The women normalized violence as “just part of the job” and used “gallows humor” as they talked with coworkers about coping with violent incidents. Scholars “should identify the practices that both dissolve… organizations’ denial about violence and also maintain their well-being” (Harris, 2018, p. 114). We embrace the “sensibility” toward gendered organizational violence(s) in the diverse contexts of the military, terrorism, sex work, separate spheres, and glass cliffs.

Costas and Grey (2018) argued that violence is “totally familiar yet hardly perceived in organizations” and “curiously both absent and present within organization studies” (p. 1574). We agree that violence is potentially visible|present or invisible|absent in organizations and therefore embrace their “sensibility” towards violence. Specifically, we consider the ways (organizational) violence is often hidden or unacknowledged because of its gendered nature. In associating masculinity and violence, Hearn (1996) argued that because organizations are usually formed via “structural relations of domination, control, and violence,” they may reproduce those very relations (p. 44). Indeed, Flores (2018) and Harris (2018) offer the term “violent gender” to truly explicate gendered violence. In this panel, we consider ways that structural, interpersonal, and/or intrapersonal gendered violence(s) are present in women’s organizational lives (James et al., 2003). A structural (institutional, systemic) perspective recognizes that violence need not be something done “by X to Y” but can rather be embedded in social relations (Costas & Grey, 2018). An interpersonal perspective corresponds to conventional definitions of violence between and among individuals and includes not only physical violence but also symbolic violence (James et al., 2003). Finally, intrapersonal violence is directed toward the self and includes not only self-harm but any attitude that damages the individual’s physical/psychological well-being and capacity for self-care (James et al., 2003). For example, Baines and Cunningham (2011) explored how women are socialized into the gendered violence of “white knuckle care work” in providing social services to clients amidst constant threat of physical violence and daily repetitive verbal abuse. “A variety of consent structures elicited the acquiescence of women to accept gendered violence at work”, capitalizing on their high degree of commitment to caring for clients, which is emphasized as natural for women (p. 768). The women normalized violence as “just part of the job” and used “gallows humor” as they talked with coworkers about coping with violent incidents. Scholars “should identify the practices that both dissolve… organizations’ denial about violence and also maintain their well-being” (Harris, 2018, p. 114). We embrace the “sensibility” toward gendered organizational violence(s) in the diverse contexts of the military, terrorism, sex work, separate spheres, and glass cliffs.

Television Production in Small Nation Countries in the On Demand Age,Panel Session,Media Industry Studies,25-May-2020,2:00 PM,3:15 PM,Star Surfer's Paradise 1 (Star),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Television production around the globe has faced extraordinary challenges and change over the last two decades. The increasingly concentrated ownership of production companies and channels by American companies and television’s internet distribution intensified existing processes of television’s globalisation. New streaming television services have upended established business models for making and circulating television, leading to the development of new alliances and ways of funding and distributing content. The popularity of subscriber-supported television services and their growing economic power are creating greater demand for television drama and children’s content in potentially lucrative global markets. These structural and economic developments have raised questions about the role of public service media and the efficacy of national cultural policies and screen agencies in supporting domestic television production in increasingly global production arrangements. These and other challenges confronting television producers are felt particularly acutely in small nations, where drama and children’s programs are seen to have particular cultural value and have historically been the preserve of public service broadcasters. Questions of content discoverability and industry sustainability are becoming more and more pressing for producers operating in small nations, given the increasing economic might of streaming services and their appetite for content with strategic value, such as drama and children’s content. This panel constructs a conversation about these issues through papers that investigate their consequences for producers in small nations including Denmark, Canada, and Australia, all suppliers of drama and children’s content as well as markets for streaming services. Each of these small nations has robust state-funded supports for drama and children’s content because of the perceived value of their contributions to national cultural representation. Each creates television that exports to other markets, including via streaming services, with which public service broadcasters will at times enter into co-production arrangements. Together, the panel investigates commonalities and differences in how these countries’ respective production cultures are negotiating both the challenges and the opportunities that streaming services present. It explores their implications for the production and cultural visibility of national drama and children’s content that can circulate in both local and global markets. In detailing particular solutions and outcomes that arise, the panel explores strategies for the sustainability of these distinctive forms of cultural production and the independent production sectors responsible for their creation at a critical moment of television’s structural transformation. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Participant: Christa Christensen, U of Copenhagen;Participant: Katrine Christensen, U of Copenhagen;Participant: Pia Jensen, Aarhus U;Participant: Amanda Lotz, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Petar Mitric, Charles U;Chairs: Anna Potter, University of Sunshine Coast;Participant: Anna Potter, University of Sunshine Coast;Participant: Eva Redvall, U of Copenhagen;Participant: Kevin Sanson, Queensland U of Technology;Participant: Serra Tinic, University of Alberta",Producing Small Nation Public Service Television Drama for Kids and Young Audiences in an Age of Multinational Streaming Services,2:00 PM,2:00 PM,E.

Public Diplomacy (PD), in turn, is a central means by which governments communicate their stories to foreign audiences and consequently has an important place in the diplomatic toolkits of political regimes across the world. While different definitions persist, PD, at its core, is about patterns and practices of transnational communication, including “a government’s process of communicating with foreign publics” (Hans N. Tuch). Not least, PD is a strategic instrument of states to enhance their soft power in the international arena. Given its real-word significance, PD has sparked a good deal of academic interest and debate, in particular over the last decade. However, important areas for further research remain. First, the concept of PD is surprisingly undertheorised. In particular, research has yet to fully explore the possible insights of approaches in communication studies or to link up to wider theoretical developments in International Relations, including the field’s recent ‘narrative turn’. Second, studies of PD have to catch up with novel communication technologies and would benefit from broadening out to non-verbal forms of communication, such as visual communication. Third, the field can be enriched by comparative and experimental research designs, cutting across democratic and non-democratic regime types. Along these lines, the panel brings together papers that make an original theoretical, empirical and/or methodological contribution to the study of PD. Theoretically, the papers explore the dynamic relationship between soft power and PD (Chitty); the role of confirmation bias and leadership cues in how publics respond to PD (Tago and Kohama); image priming theory and strategic PD narratives (Hellmann and Oppermann); and the notion of non-state diplomacy (Grincheva). Methodologically, papers report findings from innovative experimental designs (Tago and Kohama; Hellmann and Oppermann) and study pictorial communication on social media (Chitty). Empirically, the panel focuses attention on cultural diplomacy (Mark), including of non-state actors such as museums (Grincheva) and by examining the visual dimension of PD (Chitty; Hellmann and Oppermann). The papers cover both democratic (New Zealand, UK, US) and authoritarian (China, Russia, North Korea) political regimes. The panel espouses a pluralist perspective and includes papers from different disciplinary backgrounds and theoretical, epistemological and methodological orientations.

Sport Nation Region: Sport and Cultural Citizenship in Oceania,Panel Session,Sports Communication,25-May-2020,3:30 PM,4:45 PM,Star Coolangatta 4 (Star Event Centre),"Expected Attendance:50|400-word Panel Rationale:Holding ICA in different parts of the world enables local and visiting scholars to explore together both the distinctive histories and conditions in the host region, and their connections to other regions. With specific regard to the SCIG, there is an ambition to extend its membership and reach across the world. A panel focussing on sport, media and cultural citizenship is particularly appropriate in its capacity to demonstrate clear intellectual connections between the work on sport and communication being done in different parts of the world, and that conducted in the Oceania region. There is a long history of sport, communication and media research in the Oceania region. Indeed, it is in some ways a testing ground for the diffusion of sport communication uses and practices as colonies and then nations were formed in the wake of imperial expansionism. Sport offered a potent way by which ‘new’ nations could project identity both internally and externally, providing one important means by which citizens could materially demonstrate unity while enabling signifiers of nation to register in global mega media sport events. For example, the long-term involvement of Australasian nations in the summer Olympics indicates how much importance has been placed on international communication through sport. At the same time, national and regional projection through sport created extensive communicative networks that progressively integrated Oceania into the ‘new international division of cultural labour’ (Miller et al., 2001) and into the media sport empires that controlled the mediation of major leagues in sports such as association football and basketball. This dialectic of local customisation and global influence means that sport in this part of the world is connected to all regions where sport communication and media are placed in the service of social ideologies and cultural mythologies. The objective of this panel, then, is to demonstrate the role of sport in the construction of cultural citizenship, national symbolism and cultural participation in Oceania, and the cultural power and material differences that are perpetuated by these globally and transnationally-inflected processes. At the same time, it will invite dialogue with local and visiting sport communication scholars in advancing interdisciplinary knowledge of the differences and convergences evident in a range of regional contexts. |Co-Sponsorship:|Additional Information:","Chairs: Brett Hutchins, Monash U;Chairs: David Rowe, Western Sydney University",Sport–Nation–Region: Sport and Cultural Citizenship in Oceania,3:30 PM,3:30 PM,D.

Many scholarly reflections examine a variety of ways in which the datafication process occurs in many aspects of society, and how it is dissimilarly experienced and unequally benefits across class, race, and gender (Eubanks, 2018; Noble, 2018; Broussard, 2018). Of growing importance is the field of research on data activism, which sheds light on the agency and practice of citizens in datafied conditions, specifically how they intervene in or transform the existing power relations that undergird datafication. However, as Milan and Treré (2019) point out, existing research on data activism has taken for granted the theoretical views and claims made from the Western countries. Most of the current scholarly inquiries of the datafication phenomenon originate from the interests and practices of the data rich in the Western countries, whose social-political context is shaped by liberal democracies. Little attention has been paid to the dynamics of datafication and its socio-political consequences in non-Western contexts and how citizens tackle the datafication processes led by the state and corporate power in developing countries which have a different regime from the liberal democratic government. Drawing from the recently growing scholarly attention to the non-Western centric understandings of, and de-colonial approaches to “big data” (Arora, 2019; Milan and Treré, 2019; Couldry and Mejias, 2019; Chenou and Cepeda-Másmel, 2019), this panel aims to examine a variety of practices and imaginaries of data activism outside of the Western context. More specifically, we focus on the data activism in Asian countries where the modernization and democratization have followed different paths than liberal democracies in the West. Multiple interpretations of civic technologies, political activism, citizenship, and openness emerge in Asian countries and challenge the dominant theories of democracy and activism in the Anglophone Global North. Locating the emergence of data activism in the historical and political context of China, Taiwan, Indonesia and South Korea, each presenter examines the lived experiences of citizens in the state-led or marketized processes of datafication and their endeavors to democratize the data production, access, or interpretation.
